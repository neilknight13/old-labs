Normally we aren't supposed to modify main but I was having issues with the getchar()
in line 54 which was causing some type of infinite loop. Google wasn't too helpful either and I wasn't
really able to figure out what it does either. Later note, figured out to just hit enter and then
it returned to the normal command line. Still not sure what getchar() does.
