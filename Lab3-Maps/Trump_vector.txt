Well
build
the
wall
Dont
even
think
about
it
Dont
even
think
about
it
Dont
even
think
about
it
Thats
an
easy
one
Were
going
to
build
the
wall
We
need
the
wall
I
said
to
General
Kelly
how
important
is
it
He
said
very
important
Its
that
final
element
We
need
the
wall
And
its
a
wall
in
certain
areas
Obviously
where
you
have
these
massive
physical
structures
you
dont
need
and
we
have
certain
big
rivers
and
all
But
we
need
a
wall
and
were
going
to
get
that
wall
And
the
world
is
getting
the
message
They
know
that
our
border
is
no
longer
open
to
illegal
immigration
and
that
if
you
try
to
break
in
youll
be
caught
and
youll
be
returned
to
your
home
Youre
not
staying
any
longer
And
if
you
keep
coming
back
illegally
after
deportation
you
will
be
arrested
prosecuted
and
you
will
put
behind
bars
Otherwise
it
will
never
end
Lets
also
remember
that
immigration
security
is
national
security
Weve
seen
the
attacks
from

to
Boston
to
San
Bernardino
Hundreds
of
individuals
from
other
countries
have
been
charged
with
terrorismrelated
offenses
in
the
United
States
We
spend
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
on
security
all
over
the
world
but
then
we
allow
radical
Islamic
terrorists
to
enter
right
through
our
front
door
Thats
not
going
to
happen
anymore
Its
time
to
get
tough
Its
time
we
finally
got
smart
And
yes
its
also
time
to
put
America
first
And
perhaps

I
see
all
of
those
beautiful
red
and
white
hats

but
we
will
never
forget
our
favorite
slogan
of
them
all
Make
America
Great
Again
All
right
Keeping
our
communities
safe
and
protecting
our
freedoms
also
requires
the
cooperation
of
our
state
leaders
We
have
some
incredible
proSecond
Amendment
governors
here
at
the
NRA
conference
including
Governor
Scott
of
Florida
Where
is
Governor
Scott
Great
guy
doing
a
great
job
Governor
Bryant
of
Mississippi
What
a
wonderful
place
Governor
Bryant
is
here
Thank
you
Governor
Deal
of
Georgia
And
were
also
joined
by
two
people
that

well
one
I
loved
right
from
the
beginning
the
other
one
I
really
liked
didnt
like
and
now
like
a
lot
again
Does
that
make
sense
Senator
David
Perdue

he
was
from
the
beginning

and
Senator
Ted
Cruz

like
dislike
like
Where
are
they
Good
guys
Good
guys
Smart
cookies
Each
of
these
leaders
knows
that
public
officials
must
serve
under
the
Constitution
not
above
it
We
all
took
an
oath
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States

and
that
means
defending
the
Second
Amendment
So
let
me
make
a
simple
promise
to
every
one
of
the
freedomloving
Americans
in
the
audience
today
As
your
President
I
will
never
ever
infringe
on
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
Never
ever
Freedom
is
not
a
gift
from
government
Freedom
is
a
gift
from
God
It
was
this
conviction
that
stirred
the
heart
of
a
great
American
patriot
on
that
day
April

years
ago
It
was
the
day
that
Paul
Revere
spread
his
Lexington
alarm

the
famous
warning
that
the
British
are
coming
the
British
are
coming
Right
Youve
all
heard
that
right
The
British
are
coming
Now
we
have
other
people
trying
to
come
but
believe
me
theyre
not
going
to
be
successful
That
I
can
tell
you
Nothing
changes
right
folks
Nothing
changes
They
are
not
going
to
be
successful
There
will
be
serious
hurt
on
them
not
on
us
Next
came
the
shot
heard
around
the
world
and
then
a
ragtag
army
of
Godfearing
farmers
frontiersmen
shopkeepers
merchants
that
stood
up
to
the
most
powerful
army
at
that
time
on
Earth
The
most
powerful
army
on
Earth
But
we
sometimes
forget
what
inspired
those
everyday
farmers
and
workers
in
that
great
war
for
independence
Many
years
after
the
war
a
young
man
asked
Captain
Levi
Preston
aged

why
hed
fought
alongside
his
neighbors
at
Concord
Was
it
the
Stamp
Act
Was
it
the
Tea
Tax
Was
it
a
work
of
philosophy
No
the
old
veteran
replied
Then
why
he
was
asked
Young
man
the
Captain
said
what
we
meant
in
going
for
those
Redcoats
was
this
We
always
had
governed
ourselves
and
we
always
meant
to
govern
ourselves
Captain
Prestons
words
are
a
reminder
of
what
this
organization
and
my
administration
are
all
about
the
right
of
a
sovereign
people
to
govern
their
own
affairs
and
govern
them
properly
We
dont
want
any
longer
to
be
ruled
by
the
bureaucrats
in
Washington
or
in
any
other
country
for
that
matter
In
America
we
are
ruled
by
our
citizens
We
are
ruled
by
each
and
every
one
of
you
But
we
cant
be
complacent
These
are
dangerous
times
These
are
horrible
times
for
certain
obvious
reasons
But
were
going
to
make
them
great
times
again
Every
day
we
are
up
against
those
who
would
take
away
our
freedoms
restrict
our
liberties
and
even
those
who
want
to
abolish
the
Second
Amendment
We
must
be
vigilant
And
I
know
you
are
all
up
to
the
task
Since
the
first
generation
of
Americans
stood
strong
at
Concord
each
generation
to
follow
has
answered
the
call
to
defend
freedom
in
their
time
That
is
why
we
are
here
today
To
defend
freedom
for
our
children
To
defend
the
liberty
of
all
Americans
And
to
defend
the
right
of
a
free
and
sovereign
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
I
greatly
appreciated
your
support
on
November
th

in
what
will
hopefully
be
one
of
the
most
important
and
positive
elections
for
the
United
States
of
all
time
And
to
the
NRA
I
can
proudly
say
I
will
never
ever
let
you
down
Thank
you
God
Bless
you
God
Bless
our
Constitution
and
God
bless
America
Thank
you
very
much
Thank
you
Thank
you
Thank
you
everybody
thank
you
I
didnt
know
that
Melania
was
going
to
be
saying
the
Lords
Prayer
but
I
thought
that
was
very
beautiful
thank
you
thank
you
Its
so
great
to
be
here
in
Florida
My
second
home
with
you
This
is
a
state
I
truly
love
This
is
a
state
where
we
all
had
great
victory
together
Thank
you
Its
now
been
a
month
since
my
inauguration
And
I
am
here
to
tell
you
about
our
incredible
progress
in
making
America
great
again
Im
also
here
to
tell
you
about
our
plans
for
the
future
and
theyre
big
and
theyre
bold
and
Its
what
our
country
is
all
about
believe
me
Im
here
because
I
want
to
be
among
my
friends
and
among
the
people
This
was
a
great
movement
a
movement
like
has
never
been
seen
before
in
our
country
our
probably
anywhere
else
This
was
a
truly
great
movement
And
I
want
to
be
here
with
you
and
I
will
always
be
with
you
I
promise
you
that
I
want
to
be
in
a
room
filled
with
hard
working
American
patriots
who
love
their
country
who
salute
their
flag
and
who
pray
for
a
better
future
I
also
want
to
speak
to
you
without
the
filter
of
the
fake
news
The
dishonest
media
which
has
published
one
false
story
after
another
with
no
sources
even
though
they
pretend
they
have
them
they
make
them
up
in
many
cases
they
just
dont
want
to
report
the
truth
and
theyve
been
calling
us
wrong
now
for
two
years
They
dont
get
it
By
theyre
starting
to
get
it
I
can
tell
you
that
Theyve
become
a
big
part
of
the
problem
They
are
part
of
the
corrupt
system
Thomas
Jefferson
Andrew
Jackson
and
Abraham
Lincoln
and
many
of
our
greatest
presidents
fought
with
the
media
and
called
them
out
often
times
on
their
lies
When
the
media
lies
to
people
I
will
never
ever
let
them
get
away
with
it
I
will
do
whatever
I
can
that
They
dont
get
away
with
it
They
have
their
own
agenda
and
their
agenda
is
not
your
agenda
In
fact
Thomas
Jefferson
said
nothing
can
be
believed
which
is
seen
in
a
newspaper
Truth
itself
he
said
becomes
suspicious
by
being
put
into
that
polluted
vehicle
that
was
June

my
birthday

But
despite
all
their
lies
misrepresentations
and
false
stories
they
could
not
defeat
us
in
the
primaries
and
they
could
not
defeat
us
in
the
general
election
and
we
will
continue
to
expose
them
for
what
they
are
and
most
importantly
we
will
continue
to
win
win
win
We
are
not
going
to
let
the
fake
news
tell
us
what
to
do
how
to
live
or
what
to
believe
We
are
free
and
independent
people
and
we
will
make
our
own
choices
We
are
here
today
to
speak
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
I
hear
your
demands
I
hear
your
voices
and
I
promise
you
I
will
deliver
I
promise
that
And
by
the
way
youve
seen
what
weve
accomplished
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
The
White
House
is
running
so
smoothly
So
smoothly
And
believe
me
I
and
we
inherited
one
big
mess
That
I
can
tell
you
but
I
know
that
you
want
safe
neighborhoods
where
the
streets
belong
to
families
and
communities
not
gang
members
and
drug
dealers
who
are
right
now
as
I
speak
being
thrown
out
of
the
country
and
they
will
not
be
let
back
in
We
will
have
strong
borders
again
and
I
mean
that
Youve
seen
it
in
television
Youve
seen
it
on
television
General
Kelly
now
Secretary
Kelly
hes
really
doing
the
job
Youre
seeing
it
The
gang
members
bad
bad
people
I
said
day
one
and
theyre
going
out
Or
theyre
being
put
in
prison
but
for
the
most
part
get
them
the
hell
out
of
here
Bring
them
back
to
where
they
came
from
The
fact
is
you
want
great
schools
for
your
children
You
want
good
high
paying
jobs
for
yourselves
and
for
your
loved
ones
and
for
the
future
of
your
families
You
want
a
health
care
system
and
by
the
way
we
are
going
to
be
submitting
in
a
couple
of
weeks
a
great
healthcare
plan
thats
going
to
take
the
place
of
the
disaster
known
as
Obamacare
It
will
be
repealed
and
replaced
For
those
people
The
people
put
into
rooms
where
Republicans
are
talking
about
the
plan
and
it
wouldnt
matter
what
they
say
for
those
people
just
so
you
understand
our
plan
will
be
much
better
health
care
at
a
much
lower
coast
Okay
Nothing
to
complain
about
Obamacare
remember
it
is
a
disaster
You
want
low
cost
American
energy
also
which
means
lifting
the
restrictions
on
oil
on
shell
on
natural
gas
and
on
clean
very
clean
coal
Were
going
to
put
the
miners
back
to
work
The
miners
go
back
to
work
You
want
us
to
enforce
immigration
laws
and
defend
our
borders
You
want
fair
trade
deals
and
a
level
playing
field
We
dont
have
a
level
playing
field
Because
you
understand
that
when
American
workers
win
America
as
a
country
wins
and
wins
big
And
every
country
over
the
last
long
period
of
time
has
been
taking
advantage
of
the
inaudible
of
our
politicians
Its
not
going
to
happen
any
longer
You
want
lower
taxes
Less
regulation
Millions
of
new
jobs
and
more
product
stamped
with
those
beautiful
beautiful
words
Made
in
the
USA
You
want
to
make
it
easy
for
companies
to
do
business
in
America
And
harder
for
companies
to
leave
We
dont
want
companies
saying
everybody
is
fired
Were
moving
to
another
country
Were
going
to
make
the
product
Sell
it
across
the
border
and
isnt
that
wonderful
Not
going
happen
anymore
Were
going
to
have
strong
borders
and
when
they
want
to
sell
that
product
back
across
our
border
theyre
going
to
pay
a

tax
and
you
know
what
theyre
never
going
to
leave
They
will
never
ever
leave
And
youve
seen
that
because
Ive
already
displayed
it
for
the
last
two
months
even
before
I
got
into
office
Theyre
not
leaving
And
if
they
do
theyre
going
to
pay
a
big
price
for
terminating
the
relationship
with
our
workers
You
want
a
government
that
serves
the
people
not
the
donors
and
special
interest
You
want
a
government
that
keeps
its
promises
A
great
spirit
of
optimism
is
sweeping
and
you
see
it
its
sweeping
all
across
the
country
Look
at
whats
happening
to
the
stock
market
Look
at
whats
happening
to
the
every
poll
when
it
comes
to
optimism
in
our
country
Its
sweeping
across
the
country
And
in
fact
every
day
for
the
last
long
period
of
days
this
stock
market
means
companies
have
been
hitting
new
highs
Theyre
going
to
start
highs
Its
going
to
be
a
new
day
in
America
Youre
going
to
be
proud
again
Jobs
are
already
starting
to
pour
back
in
Theyre
coming
back
in
like
you
havent
seen
in
a
long
time
Ford
General
Motors
Fiat
Chrysler
are
bringing
in
and
bringing
back
thousands
of
jobs
investing
billions
of
dollars
because
of
the
new
business
climate
that
we
are
creating
in
our
country
In
Arizona
Intel
great
company
just
announced
it
will
open
a
new
plant
that
will
create
at
least

brand
new
beautiful
American
jobs
I
followed
through
on
my
promise
to
withdraw
from
the
job
killing
disaster
known
as
the
TransPacific
Partnership
TPP
we
have
just
terminated
our
relationship
to
it
Were
going
to
have
tremendous
trade
deals
all
over
the
world
but
theyre
going
to
be
bilateral
or
as
we
would
say
oneonone
None
of
these
deals
where
we
get
caught
in
quicksand
Get
mired
in
and
we
cant
do
anything
about
it
By
the
way
NAFTA
and
so
many
others
My
administration
has
begun
plans
to
crack
down
on
foreign
cheating
and
currency
manipulation
which
is
killing
our
companies
and
really
really
hurting
our
workers
Were
going
to
end
it
Within
a
few
days
of
taking
the
oath
of
office
Ive
taken
steps
to
begin
the
construction
of
the
Keystone
and
the
Dakota
Access
Pipelines
Anywhere
from

jobs
And
very
importantly
as
I
was
about
to
sign
it
I
said
who
makes
the
pipe
Who
makes
the
pipe
Something
this
audience
understands
very
well
right
Simple
question
The
lawyers
put
this
very
complex
document
in
front
I
said
who
makes
the
pipe
They
said
sir
it
can
be
made
anywhere
I
said
not
anymore
I
put
a
little
clause
in
the
bottom
The
pipe
has
to
be
made
in
the
United
States
of
America
if
were
going
to
have
pine
line
We
believe
in
two
simple
rules
I
can
tell
you
everybody
in
this
massive
this
is
a
massive
hanger
For
the
big
planes
And
by
the
way
do
you
think
that
one
media
group
back
there
one
network
will
show
this
crowd
Not
one
Not
one
They
wont
show
the
crowd
You
know
coming
in
on
the
plane
and
that
plane
represented
so
much
And
just
so
you
know
they
were
close
to
signing
a

billion
deal
to
have
a
new
Air
Force
One
Can
you
believe
this
I
said
no
way
I
said
I
refuse
to
fly
in
a

billion
airplane
I
refuse
So
I
got
Boeing
and
it
is
actually

a
lot
of
people
dont
know
The
Air
Force
One
project
is
actually
two
planes
Why
they
need
to
planes
well
have
to
talk
about
that
but
they
have
two
planes
but
weve
got
that
price
down
over
a
billion
dollars
and
I
probably
have
it
spoken
to
be
honest
with
you
for
honest
probably
an
more
than
an
hour
on
the
project
I
got
the
generals
in
who
are
fantastic
I
got
Boeing
in
I
told
Boeing
its
not
good
enough
Were
still
not
going
to
do
it
The
price
is
still
too
high
On
the
fighter
jet
We
were
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
over
budget
Seven
years
late
great
plane
A
great
plane
So
think
of
it
Theyre
seven
years
late
Hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
overbudget
Other
than
that
by
the
way
the
project
is
going
extremely
well
And
I
got
the
folks
in
from
Lockheed
Martin
who
are
terrific
people
and
a
terrific
product
by
the
way
I
also
got
Boeing
in
I
said
do
me
a
favor
give
me
a
competing
offer
And
now
theyre
competing
and
fighting
and
weve
gotten
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
off
the
price
of
a
plane
that
was
going
to
be
ordered
in
other
words
if
my
opponent
got
in
there
would
have
been
no
calls
made
to
them
They
would
have
signed
contracts
So
theyre
going
to
make
plenty
of
money
but
its
going
to
be
a
lot
less
than
they
would
have
made
without
Trump
That
I
can
tell
you
You
might
as
well
know
about
it
Nobody
talks
By
the
way
thats
for
fighter
jets
One
of
the
biggest
orders
in
the
history
of
aviation
The
order
for
the
F
Youve
been
reading
about
it
because
it
was
a
disaster
Under
the
last
administration
A
disaster
And
now
we
have
it
running
beautifully
In
fact
when
the
Prime
Minister
of
Japan
Prime
Minister
Abe
was
great
Great
guy
When
he
came
over
he
said
thank
you
I
said
for
what
You
saved
us
many
many
millions
of
dollars
on
the
F
fighter
jet
Because
when
I
negotiated
I
took
our
allies
into
the
same
negotiation
So
the
first
thing
he
did
was
thanked
med
for
saving
them
money
and
thats
good
Okay
Thats
good
I
know
the
media
will
never
thank
me
so
at
least
Japan
is
thanking
me
right
But
we
believe
in
two
simple
rules
Buy
American
and
hire
American
We
believe
it
Weve
just
issued
a
new
order
which
requires
that
for
every
one
new
regulation
two
old
regulations
must
be
eliminated
And
by
the
way
a
new
director
was
just
approved
Can
you
imagine
the
length
of
time
its
taken
to
Democrats
and
I
actually
think
its
an
embarrassment
to
them
but
this
is
getting
in
to
be
record
setting
time
Incredible
people
Scott
Pruitt
was
just
approved
just
now
approved
for
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
Hell
do
so
good
He
wont
have
projects
going
ten
and

years
and
getting
rejected
They
may
be
rejected
but
theyll
be
rejected
quickly
For
the
most
part
theyre
going
to
be
accepted
Theyre
going
to
be
environmentally
friendly
and
he
is
going
to
be
a
great
Secretary
He
will
be
amazing
Were
very
happy
That
took
place
yesterday
Thats
going
to
be
a
big
difference
because
they
were
clogging
up
the
veins
of
our
country
with
the
environmental
impact
statements
and
all
of
the
rules
and
regulations
It
was
impossible
to
navigate
for
companies
And
what
did
it
really
mean
Forget
about
the
companies
What
did
it
mean
It
meant
no
jobs
It
meant
companies
leaving
our
country
and
going
to
foreign
countries
to
do
things
they
would
rather
do
here
So
were
going
to
have
a
whole
big
situation
We
are
going
to
unfreeze
all
of
those
companies
They
are
going
to
be

theyre
going
have
freedom
Be
able
to
build
what
they
want
to
build
It
will
be
environmentally
friendly
and
were
going
to
start
producing
jobs
like
youve
never
seen
before
Thats
going
to
happen
That
was
a
big
thing
Were
standing
up
for
the
incredible
men
and
women
always
of
law
enforcement
Were
standing
up
And
I
can
tell
you
the
military
and
law
enforcement
they
stood
up
I
dont
say
for
me
Im
the
messenger
folks
Im
the
messenger
They
stood
up
for
us
in
this
last
election
We
got
numbers
that
nobody
believed
were
possible
from
law
enforcement
and
from
military
Basically
people
they
wear
uniforms
like
us
Isnt
that
nice
I
saw
this
man
on
TV
just
now
you
I
just
saw
him
on
television
He
said
I
love
Trump
Let
Trump
do
what
he
has
to
do
Thats
my
guy
right
there
Come
here
Come
here
No
I
just
Im
coming
in
Thats
okay
Let
him
up
Im
not
worried
about
him
Im
only
worried
hes
going
to
give
me
a
kiss
Im
not
worried
about
anything
else
This
guy
is
so
great
He
was
one
of
many
people
Theyre
interviewing
people
in
the
line
And
I
have
to
say
there
was
a
tiny
group
of
protesters
out
there
and
they
were
given
as
much
publicity
as
this
massive
room
packed
with
people
but
they
interviewed
this
man
Come
on
up
here
Come
on
up
Guy
was
great
Hop
over
the
fence
Come
on
He
can
do
it
Hes
in
good
shape
Look
at
him
Look
at
this
guy
Come
on
This
guy
is
great
Dont
worry
about
him
No
no
Come
here
Theyre
going
to

come
on
up
Come
here
This
guy
So
hes
been
all
over
television
saying
the
best
things
and
I
see
him
standing
and
didnt
you
get
here
at
like

in
the
morning
Say
a
couple
of
words
to
this
crowd
A
star
is
born
I
wouldnt
say
that
Secret
Service
was
thrilled
with
that
but
we
know
our
people
right
We
know
our
people
Great
guy
And
so
many
others
I
see
some
others
Being
interviewed
I
see
them
over
here
They
started
They
came
at

in
the
morning
The
media
will
give
them
no
credit
The
media
as
I
told
you
wont
show
this
crowd
All
the
way
outside
of
this

this
is
a
big
a
hanger
as
you
get
All
the
way
outside
Way
back
to
the
fences
Amazing
I
want
to
thank
you
but
I
want
to
thank
everybody
Ive
directed
the
Department
of
Justice
to
take
a
firm
firm
stance
to
protect
our
cops
sheriffs
and
police
from
crimes
of
violence
against
them
We
will
work
with
our
police
not
against
our
police
our
police
do
a
great
job
and
theyve
never
been
troubled
like
theyre
troubled
now
Its
very
unfair
whats
happening
So
we
want
to
cherish
our
law
enforcement
We
will
always
protect
those
who
protect
us
Weve
directed
the
creation
of
a
task
force
for
reducing
violent
crime
in
America
including
our
inner
cities
Were
going
to
make
our
inner
cities
safe
again
Look
at
whats
going
on
Look
at
whats
happening
in
Chicago
Hundreds
of
shootings
hundreds
of
deaths
Ill
tell
you
whats
happening
in
Chicago
and
many
other
places
Safety
is
a
civil
right
And
we
will
fight
to
make
America
totally
safe
again
Ive
ordered
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
the
Department
of
Justice
to
coordinate
on
a
plan
to
destroy
transnational
criminal
cartels
which
are
all
over
the
United
States
and
we
are
going
to
stop
the
drugs
from
pours
into
your
country
into
your
community
into
your
cities
and
poisoning
our
youth
Were
stopping
it
Were
stopping
it
Weve
taken
historic
action
to
secure
the
southern
border
and
Ive
ordered
the
construction
of
a
great
border
wall
which
will
start
very
shortly
And
Ive
taken
decisive
action
to
keep
radical
Islamic
terrorist
the
hell
out
of
our
country
So
you
probably
read
where
we
want
to
enforce
the
laws
as
existing
And
so
we
signed
an
order
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
it
was
taken
over
by
a
court
originally
by
a
judge
and
then
a

yes
its
very
sad
The
reason
is
for
protection
and
safety
So
the
statute
is
so
plain
and
so
clear
I
said
last
week
I
was
speaking
to
a
great
group
of
sheriffs
the
sheriffs
group
in
Washington
and
I
said
if
you
have
a
college
education
you
can
understand
its
If
you
have
a
high
school
education
you
can
understand
it
If
you
were
a
bad
student
in
high
school
you
can
understand
it
I
was
told
Ill
check
but
I
found
it
hard
to
believe
over
page
decision
by
the
appellate
court
Three
judges
And
you
could
tell
by
the
way
they
were
reacting
because
it
was
broadcast
on
television
Everything
we
do
gets
a
lot
of
people
watching
So
you
could
tell
by
the
way
that
phone
call
went
wasnt
looking
good
When
they
wrote
their
decision
as
I
understand
it
Maybe
Im
wrong
They
didnt
write
the
statute
they
were
making
the
decision
about
because
every
word
of
the
statute
is
a
total
kill
for
the
other
side
So
I
thought
I
would
read
it
And
heres
what
it
says
This
is
what
it
says
Whenever
the
President
finds
that
the
entry
of
any
aliens
or
any
class
of
aliens
into
the
United
States

okay
So
essentially
Whenever
somebody
comes
into
the
United
States
Right
If
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
the
United
States

okay
Now
you
know
the
countrys
were
talking
about
and
these
were
countries
picked
by
Obama
They
werent
even
picked
They
were
picked
by
Obama
He
may
so
the
President
may
by
proclamation
and
for
such
period
as
he
shall
deem
necessary

now
because
it
should
have
said
he
or
she
right
They
were
not
politically
correct
when
they
drew
this
In
fact
thats
the
only
thing
that
was
actually
wrong
with
it
He
or
she
I
dont
think
the
women
care
too
much
about
that
Right
I
dont
think
so
By
the
way
we
did
very
well
with
women
You
know
my
wife
said
when
some
of
these
phony
polls
were
put
out
the
CNN
poll
was
so
far
off
the
phony
polls
When
some
of
these
she
said
whats
wrong
with
you
and
women
We
did
very
nicely
with
women
We
did
nicely
with
a
lot
of
groups
they
didnt
think
we
were
going
to
do
so
nicely
with
I
guess
we
had
to
Thats
why
were
all
here
tonight
Right
So
and
it
goes
for
such
as
he
shall
seem
necessary
suspend
the
entry
of
all
aliens
or
any
class
of
aliens
as
immigrants
or
nonimmigrants
or
impose
on
aliens
any
restriction
he
may
deem
to
be
appropriate
So
basically
it
says
the
president
has
the
right
to
keep
people
out
if
he
feels
its
not
in
the
best
interest
of
our
country
Right
Unbelievable
Unbelievable
And
I
listened
to
these
judges
talk
and
talk
and
talk
So
unfair
So
well
be
doing
something
over
the
next
couple
of
days
We
dont
give
up
We
never
give
up
We
had
a
court
that
I
disagree
with
I
disagree
with
big
league

and
by
the
way
whether
you
read
it
or
whether
you
watch
it
on
television
when
other
lawyers
come
on
many
of
them
cant
even
understand
Theyre
saying
how
do
you
come
up
with
that
decision
It
cannot
be
more
simple
So
theyre
ruling
on
what
I
just
read
you
and
they
dont
even
quote
it
in
their
ruling
because
you
cant
because
its
too
obvious
So
we
will
do
something
next
week
I
think
youll
be
impressed
Lets
see
what
happens
Heres
the
bottom
line
Weve
got
to
keep
our
country
safe
You
look
at
whats
happening
Weve
got
to
keep
our
country
safe
You
look
at
whats
happening
in
Germany
you
look
at
whats
happening
last
night
in
Sweden
Sweden
who
would
believe
this
Sweden
They
took
in
large
numbers
Theyre
having
problems
like
they
never
thought
possible
You
look
at
whats
happening
in
Brussels
You
look
at
whats
happening
all
over
the
world
Take
a
look
at
Nice
Take
a
look
at
Paris
Weve
allowed
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
into
our
country
and
there
was
no
way
to
vet
those
people
There
was
no
documentation
There
was
no
nothing
So
were
going
to
keep
our
country
safe
And
we
all
have
heart
by
the
way
And
what
I
want
to
do
is
build
safe
zones
in
Syria
and
other
places
so
they
can
stay
there
and
live
safely
until
their
cities
and
their
country
that
mess
that
I
was
left
by
Obama
and
everybody
else

folks
we
were
left
a
mess
like
you
wouldnt
believe
but
were
going
to
build
safe
zones
Were
going
to
have
those
safe
zones
We
do
owe

trillion
Okay
So
were
going
to
have
the
gulf
states
pay
for
those
safe
zones
Theyve
got
nothing
but
money
Were
going
to
do
it
that
way
instead
of
taking
massive
numbers
Tens
the
of
thousands
of
people
into
our
country
and
we
dont
know
anything
about
those
people
We
want
people
to
come
into
our
country
but
we
want
people
that
love
us
We
want
people
that
can
cherish
us
and
the
traditions
of
our
country
We
want
people
that
are
going
to
be
great
for
our
country
We
dont
want
people
with
bad
bad
ideas
We
dont
want
that
Ive
also
directed
the
defense
community
headed
by
General
now

you
know
he
said
it
he
said
it

and
now
Secretary
Mad
Dog
Mattis
to
develop
a
plan
to
totally
destroy
ISIS
I
have
ordered
the
department
of
defense
to
begin
plans
for
the
great
rebuilding
of
the
united
states
military
We
will
pursue
peace
through
strength
Our
military
is
badly
depleted
You
have
planes
in
the
military
Where
the
father
flew
them
and
now
the
son
is
flying
them
Their
so
old
We
make
the
best
equipment
anywhere
in
the
world
Were
going
to
start
using
our
best
and
most
modern
equipment
And
were
going
to
make
sure
our
veterans
have
the
care
they
need
when
they
come
home
We
love
our
veterans
Were
going
to
do
a
great
job
for
our
veterans
Our
veterans
have
been
very
very
sadly
treated
These
are
our
great
great
people
We
owe
them
so
much
Our
veterans
are
going
to
be
taken
care
of
for
once
and
for
all
Our
system
and
our
country
has
led
down
our
veterans
We
are
not
going
to
let
that
go
on
any
further
You
wait
and
you
see
what
were
going
to
be
doing
for
our
great
veterans
Thank
you
veterans
Who
is
here
Who
is
a
veteran
Were
going
to
take
care
of
our
veterans
Were
going
to
downsize
the
bloated
bloated
bureaucracy
which
make
the
government
lien
and
accountable
Were
going
to
drain
the
swamp
in
Washington
DC
Ive
already
imposed
a
five
year
lobbying
ban
on
the
executive
branch
officials
and
lifetime
ban
on
lobbying
for
a
foreign
government
And
theres
another
major
promise
I
have
kept
to
the
American
people
Ive
nominated
a
fantastic
justice
to
replace
the
late
great
Justice
Scalia
His
name
is
Judge
Neil
Gorsuch
He
comes
from
my
list
of

very
very
highly
qualified
judges
Hes
incredible
and
has
an
incredible
resume
Hes
respected
by
all
His
education
is
as
good
as
it
can
get
His
writings
are
truly
amazing
He
will
be
a
true
true
defender
of
our
constitution
So
lets
tell
the
Senate
Democrats
to
support
his
nomination
for
the
good
of
the
country
because
whats
happening
with
the
Democrats

no
wonder
theyre
doing
so
badly
No
wonder
theyre
doing
so
badly
You
take
a
look
race
after
race
I
just
want
the
tell
you
in
case
you
didnt
read
it
of
course
youre
reading
the
fake
news
but
the
Democrats
were
supposed
to
win
the
presidency
That
didnt
happen
They
were
supposed
to
take
over
the
Senate
That
didnt
happen
And
they
were
supposed
to
take
over
potentially
even
the
House
It
was
going
to
be
four
weeks
out
the
greatest
defeat
in
the
modern
history
of
American
politics
And
it
was
but
it
was
for
the
Democrats
not
for
the
Republicans
So
we
have
to
tell
the
Democrats
because
theyre
doing
the
wrong
thing
for
the
American
people
to
stop
their
tactics
of
delay
and
obstruction
and
destruction
They
got
to
get
on
with
it
My
administration
is
also
pushing
ahead
strongly
with
very
historic
tax
reform
We
are
working
to
lower
tax
rates
in
the
middle
class
to
reduce
tax
rates
big
league
on
businesses
and
to
make
our
tax
code
more
fair
and
very
simple
for
all
Americans
so
its
understandable
by
everyone
Senate
Democrats
should
work
with
us
to
lower
taxes
and
bring
back
our
jobs
but
the
Democrats
want
to
increase
your
taxes
very
very
substantially
Were
not
going
let
that
happen
Also
time
for
the
Senate
Democrats
to
take
responsibility
for
Obamacare
and
to
work
with
us
to
replace
it
with
new
reforms
that
reverse
this
nationwide
healthcare
tragedy
Its
a
tragedy
You
look
at
some
states
Arizona
up

Your
deductibles
have
gone
so
high
you
can
never
use
it
Obamacare
doesnt
work
Its
become
totally
unaffordable
Remember
they
said
the
healthcare
its
unaffordable
It
doesnt
work
And
I
said
to
the
Republicans
I
said
you
want
to
do
something
great
politically
dont
do
anything
Sit
back
for
two
years
let
it
explode
The
Democrats
will
come
and
beg
for
us
to
do
something
but
we
cant
do
that
to
the
American
people
We
have
to
fix
it
And
we
will
We
need
members
of
both
parties
to
join
hands
and
work
with
us
to
pass
a

trillion
infrastructure
plan
to
build
new
roads
and
bridges
and
airports
and
tunnels
and
highways
and
railways
all
across
our
great
nation
Youre
all
part
of
this
incredible
movement
This
movement
that
we
talk
about
so
much
Thats
been
written
about
on
the
cover
of
every
magazine
all
over
the
world
Its
a
movement
that
is
just
sweeping
Its
sweeping
across
our
country
Its
sweeping
frankly
across
the
globe
Look
at
Brexit
Look
at
Brexit
Much
smaller
example
but
its
still
something
you
can
look
at
People
want
to
take
back
control
of
their
countries
and
they
want
to
take
back
control
of
their
lives
and
the
lives
of
their
family
The
nation
state
remains
the
best
model
for
human
happiness
and
the
American
nation
remains
the
greatest
symbol
of
liberty
of
freedom
and
justice
on
the
face
of
gods
earth
And
now
we
have
spirit
like
weve
never
had
before
Its
now
that
we
have
our
sacred
duty
and
we
have
no
choice
and
we
want
this
choice
to
defend
our
country
to
protect
its
values
and
to
serve
its
great
great
citizens
Erasing
national
borders
does
not
make
people
safer
It
undermines
democracy
and
trade
prosperity
Were
giving
it
away
The
socalled
global
elite
have
done
well
for
themselves
but
left
working
families
with
shrinking
wages
Really
they
are
shrinking

years
ago
though
many
of
you
in
this
room
made
more
money
working
one
job
than
youre
making
right
now
working
two
and
three
jobs
Instead
of
peace
weve
seen
wars
that
never
end
and
conflicts
that
never
seem
to
go
away
We
dont
fight
to
win
We
fight
politically
correct
wars
We
dont
win
anymore
We
dont
win
at
trade
We
dont
win
in
any
capacity
We
dont
win
anymore
Were
going
to
start
winning
again
Believe
me
And
we
have
the
chance
now
working
together
to
deliver
change
for
the
ages
This
will
be
change
for
the
ages
Change
like
never
before
To
pursue
real
peace
real
stability
and
real
prosperity
We
want
to
secure
our
borders
and
protect
our
workers
To
rebuild
our
military
and
our
infrastructure
To
fix
our
schools
and
restore
safety
to
our
neighborhoods
To
bring
hope
and
opportunity
to
our
inner
cities
To
ensure
a
level
playing
field
for
all
women
in
the
workforce
To
reform
our
tax
code
and
remove
the
regulations
that
undermine
growth
and
innovation
And
to
replace
chaos
and
distrust
with
community
and
cooperation
The
tired
echoes
of
yesterdays
fights
Were
fighting
battles
that
no
longer
help
us
Were
fighting
battles
that
other
people
arent
treating
us
fairly
in
the
fight
Im
a
NATO
fan
but
many
of
the
countries
in
NATO
many
of
the
countries
that
we
protect
many
of
these
countries
are
very
rich
countries
Theyre
not
paying
their
bills
Theyre
not
paying
their
bills
They
have
to
help
us
No
longer
are
we
chained
down
by
the
discredited
approaches
of
the
past
No
longer
must
we
listen
to
those
who
have
nothing
to
brag
about
but
failure
New
circumstances
demand
new
solutions
Americans
have
fought
and
won
wars
together
Our
heroes
have
shed
their
blood
together
and
lost
their
lives
Our
citizens
have
raised
their
children
together
fought
for
justice
together
and
shared
common
hopes
and
dreams
from
one
generation
to
the
next
Stretching
back
to
the
first
day
of
our
American
independence
This
is
our
legacy
It
belongs
to
all
of
you
And
it
belongs
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
our
nation
Now
is
the
time
to
call
upon
these
deep
ties
in
the
name
of
bold
acts
Let
us
move
past
the
differences
party
and
find
a
new
loyalty
rooted
deeply
in
our
country
We
are
all
brothers
and
all
sisters
We
share
one
home
One
destiny
and
one
glorious
American
flag
We
are
united
together
by
history
and
by
providence
We
will
make
America
strong
again
I
promise
We
will
make
America
proud
again
We
will
make
America
safe
again
And
we
will
make
America
great
again
Greater
than
ever
before
May
God
bless
you
and
may
God
bless
the
United
States
of
America
Thank
you
Thank
you
Thank
you
very
much
Thank
you
very
much
Thank
you
Please
be

Vice
President
Pence
Secretary
of
State
Tillerson
members
of
the
Cabinet
General
Dunford
Deputy
Secretary
Shanahan
and
Colonel
Duggan
Most
especially
thank
you
to
the
men
and
women
of
Fort
Myer
and
every
member
of
the
United
States
military
at
home
and
abroad
We
send
our
thoughts
and
prayers
to
the
families
of
our
brave
sailors
who
were
injured
and
lost
after
a
tragic
collision
at
sea
as
well
as
to
those
conducting
the
search
and
recovery
efforts
I
am
here
tonight
to
lay
out
our
path
forward
in
Afghanistan
and
South
Asia
But
before
I
provide
the
details
of
our
new
strategy
I
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
servicemembers
here
with
us
tonight
to
those
watching
from
their
posts
and
to
all
Americans
listening
at
home
Since
the
founding
of
our
republic
our
country
has
produced
a
special
class
of
heroes
whose
selflessness
courage
and
resolve
is
unmatched
in
human
history
American
patriots
from
every
generation
have
given
their
last
breath
on
the
battlefield
for
our
nation
and
for
our
freedom
Through
their
lives

and
though
their
lives
were
cut
short
in
their
deeds
they
achieved
total
immortality
By
following
the
heroic
example
of
those
who
fought
to
preserve
our
republic
we
can
find
the
inspiration
our
country
needs
to
unify
to
heal
and
to
remain
one
nation
under
God
The
men
and
women
of
our
military
operate
as
one
team
with
one
shared
mission
and
one
shared
sense
of
purpose
They
transcend
every
line
of
race
ethnicity
creed
and
color
to
serve
together

and
sacrifice
together

in
absolutely
perfect
cohesion
That
is
because
all
service
members
are
brothers
and
sisters
Theyre
all
part
of
the
same
family
its
called
the
American
family
They
take
the
same
oath
fight
for
the
same
flag
and
live
according
to
the
same
law
They
are
bound
together
by
common
purpose
mutual
trust
and
selfless
devotion
to
our
nation
and
to
each
other
The
soldier
understands
what
we
as
a
nation
too
often
forget
that
a
wound
inflicted
upon
a
single
member
of
our
community
is
a
wound
inflicted
upon
us
all
When
one
part
of
America
hurts
we
all
hurt
And
when
one
citizen
suffers
an
injustice
we
all
suffer
together
Loyalty
to
our
nation
demands
loyalty
to
one
another
Love
for
America
requires
love
for
all
of
its
people
When
we
open
our
hearts
to
patriotism
there
is
no
room
for
prejudice
no
place
for
bigotry
and
no
tolerance
for
hate
The
young
men
and
women
we
send
to
fight
our
wars
abroad
deserve
to
return
to
a
country
that
is
not
at
war
with
itself
at
home
We
cannot
remain
a
force
for
peace
in
the
world
if
we
are
not
at
peace
with
each
other
As
we
send
our
bravest
to
defeat
our
enemies
overseas

and
we
will
always
win

let
us
find
the
courage
to
heal
our
divisions
within
Let
us
make
a
simple
promise
to
the
men
and
women
we
ask
to
fight
in
our
name
that
when
they
return
home
from
battle
they
will
find
a
country
that
has
renewed
the
sacred
bonds
of
love
and
loyalty
that
unite
us
together
as
one
Thanks
to
the
vigilance
and
skill
of
the
American
military
and
of
our
many
allies
throughout
the
world
horrors
on
the
scale
of
September
th

and
nobody
can
ever
forget
that

have
not
been
repeated
on
our
shores
But
we
must
also
acknowledge
the
reality
I
am
here
to
talk
about
tonight
that
nearly

years
after
September
th
attacks
after
the
extraordinary
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
the
American
people
are
weary
of
war
without
victory
Nowhere
is
this
more
evident
than
with
the
war
in
Afghanistan
the
longest
war
in
American
history


years
I
share
the
American
peoples
frustration
I
also
share
their
frustration
over
a
foreign
policy
that
has
spent
too
much
time
energy
money
and
most
importantly
lives
trying
to
rebuild
countries
in
our
own
image
instead
of
pursuing
our
security
interests
above
all
other
considerations
That
is
why
shortly
after
my
inauguration
I
directed
Secretary
of
Defense
Mattis
and
my
national
security
team
to
undertake
a
comprehensive
review
of
all
strategic
options
in
Afghanistan
and
South
Asia
My
original
instinct
was
to
pull
out

and
historically
I
like
following
my
instincts
But
all
my
life
Ive
heard
that
decisions
are
much
different
when
you
sit
behind
the
desk
in
the
Oval
Office
in
other
words
when
youre
President
of
the
United
States
So
I
studied
Afghanistan
in
great
detail
and
from
every
conceivable
angle
After
many
meetings
over
many
months
we
held
our
final
meeting
last
Friday
at
Camp
David
with
my
Cabinet
and
generals
to
complete
our
strategy
I
arrived
at
three
fundamental
conclusions
about
Americas
core
interests
in
Afghanistan
First
our
nation
must
seek
an
honorable
and
enduring
outcome
worthy
of
the
tremendous
sacrifices
that
have
been
made
especially
the
sacrifices
of
lives
The
men
and
women
who
serve
our
nation
in
combat
deserve
a
plan
for
victory
They
deserve
the
tools
they
need
and
the
trust
they
have
earned
to
fight
and
to
win
Second
the
consequences
of
a
rapid
exit
are
both
predictable
and
unacceptable

the
worst
terrorist
attack
in
our
history
was
planned
and
directed
from
Afghanistan
because
that
country
was
ruled
by
a
government
that
gave
comfort
and
shelter
to
terrorists
A
hasty
withdrawal
would
create
a
vacuum
that
terrorists
including
ISIS
and
al
Qaeda
would
instantly
fill
just
as
happened
before
September
th
And
as
we
know
in

America
hastily
and
mistakenly
withdrew
from
Iraq
As
a
result
our
hardwon
gains
slipped
back
into
the
hands
of
terrorist
enemies
Our
soldiers
watched
as
cities
they
had
fought
for
and
bled
to
liberate
and
won
were
occupied
by
a
terrorist
group
called
ISIS
The
vacuum
we
created
by
leaving
too
soon
gave
safe
haven
for
ISIS
to
spread
to
grow
recruit
and
launch
attacks
We
cannot
repeat
in
Afghanistan
the
mistake
our
leaders
made
in
Iraq
Third
and
finally
I
concluded
that
the
security
threats
we
face
in
Afghanistan
and
the
broader
region
are
immense
Today

USdesignated
foreign
terrorist
organizations
are
active
in
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan

the
highest
concentration
in
any
region
anywhere
in
the
world
For
its
part
Pakistan
often
gives
safe
haven
to
agents
of
chaos
violence
and
terror
The
threat
is
worse
because
Pakistan
and
India
are
two
nucleararmed
states
whose
tense
relations
threaten
to
spiral
into
conflict
And
that
could
happen
No
one
denies
that
we
have
inherited
a
challenging
and
troubling
situation
in
Afghanistan
and
South
Asia
but
we
do
not
have
the
luxury
of
going
back
in
time
and
making
different
or
better
decisions
When
I
became
President
I
was
given
a
bad
and
very
complex
hand
but
I
fully
knew
what
I
was
getting
into
big
and
intricate
problems
But
one
way
or
another
these
problems
will
be
solved

Im
a
problem
solver

and
in
the
end
we
will
win
We
must
address
the
reality
of
the
world
as
it
exists
right
now

the
threats
we
face
and
the
confronting
of
all
of
the
problems
of
today
and
extremely
predictable
consequences
of
a
hasty
withdrawal
We
need
look
no
further
than
last
weeks
vile
vicious
attack
in
Barcelona
to
understand
that
terror
groups
will
stop
at
nothing
to
commit
the
mass
murder
of
innocent
men
women
and
children
You
saw
it
for
yourself
Horrible
As
I
outlined
in
my
speech
in
Saudi
Arabia
three
months
ago
America
and
our
partners
are
committed
to
stripping
terrorists
of
their
territory
cutting
off
their
funding
and
exposing
the
false
allure
of
their
evil
ideology
Terrorists
who
slaughter
innocent
people
will
find
no
glory
in
this
life
or
the
next
They
are
nothing
but
thugs
and
criminals
and
predators
and

thats
right

losers
Working
alongside
our
allies
we
will
break
their
will
dry
up
their
recruitment
keep
them
from
crossing
our
borders
and
yes
we
will
defeat
them
and
we
will
defeat
them
handily
In
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
Americas
interests
are
clear
We
must
stop
the
resurgence
of
safe
havens
that
enable
terrorists
to
threaten
America
and
we
must
prevent
nuclear
weapons
and
materials
from
coming
into
the
hands
of
terrorists
and
being
used
against
us
or
anywhere
in
the
world
for
that
matter
But
to
prosecute
this
war
we
will
learn
from
history
As
a
result
of
our
comprehensive
review
American
strategy
in
Afghanistan
and
South
Asia
will
change
dramatically
in
the
following
ways
A
core
pillar
of
our
new
strategy
is
a
shift
from
a
timebased
approach
to
one
based
on
conditions
Ive
said
it
many
times
how
counterproductive
it
is
for
the
United
States
to
announce
in
advance
the
dates
we
intend
to
begin
or
end
military
options
We
will
not
talk
about
numbers
of
troops
or
our
plans
for
further
military
activities
Conditions
on
the
ground

not
arbitrary
timetables

will
guide
our
strategy
from
now
on
Americas
enemies
must
never
know
our
plans
or
believe
they
can
wait
us
out
I
will
not
say
when
we
are
going
to
attack
but
attack
we
will
Another
fundamental
pillar
of
our
new
strategy
is
the
integration
of
all
instruments
of
American
power

diplomatic
economic
and
military

toward
a
successful
outcome
Someday
after
an
effective
military
effort
perhaps
it
will
be
possible
to
have
a
political
settlement
that
includes
elements
of
the
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
but
nobody
knows
if
or
when
that
will
ever
happen
America
will
continue
its
support
for
the
Afghan
government
and
the
Afghan
military
as
they
confront
the
Taliban
in
the
field
Ultimately
it
is
up
to
the
people
of
Afghanistan
to
take
ownership
of
their
future
to
govern
their
society
and
to
achieve
an
everlasting
peace
We
are
a
partner
and
a
friend
but
we
will
not
dictate
to
the
Afghan
people
how
to
live
or
how
to
govern
their
own
complex
society
We
are
not
nationbuilding
again
We
are
killing
terrorists
The
next
pillar
of
our
new
strategy
is
to
change
the
approach
and
how
to
deal
with
Pakistan
We
can
no
longer
be
silent
about
Pakistans
safe
havens
for
terrorist
organizations
the
Taliban
and
other
groups
that
pose
a
threat
to
the
region
and
beyond
Pakistan
has
much
to
gain
from
partnering
with
our
effort
in
Afghanistan
It
has
much
to
lose
by
continuing
to
harbor
criminals
and
terrorists
In
the
past
Pakistan
has
been
a
valued
partner
Our
militaries
have
worked
together
against
common
enemies
The
Pakistani
people
have
suffered
greatly
from
terrorism
and
extremism
We
recognize
those
contributions
and
those
sacrifices
But
Pakistan
has
also
sheltered
the
same
organizations
that
try
every
single
day
to
kill
our
people
We
have
been
paying
Pakistan
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
at
the
same
time
they
are
housing
the
very
terrorists
that
we
are
fighting
But
that
will
have
to
change
and
that
will
change
immediately
No
partnership
can
survive
a
countrys
harboring
of
militants
and
terrorists
who
target
US
service
members
and
officials
It
is
time
for
Pakistan
to
demonstrate
its
commitment
to
civilization
order
and
to
peace
Another
critical
part
of
the
South
Asia
strategy
for
America
is
to
further
develop
its
strategic
partnership
with
India

the
worlds
largest
democracy
and
a
key
security
and
economic
partner
of
the
United
States
We
appreciate
Indias
important
contributions
to
stability
in
Afghanistan
but
India
makes
billions
of
dollars
in
trade
with
the
United
States
and
we
want
them
to
help
us
more
with
Afghanistan
especially
in
the
area
of
economic
assistance
and
development
We
are
committed
to
pursuing
our
shared
objectives
for
peace
and
security
in
South
Asia
and
the
broader
IndoPacific
region
Finally
my
administration
will
ensure
that
you
the
brave
defenders
of
the
American
people
will
have
the
necessary
tools
and
rules
of
engagement
to
make
this
strategy
work
and
work
effectively
and
work
quickly
I
have
already
lifted
restrictions
the
previous
administration
placed
on
our
warfighters
that
prevented
the
Secretary
of
Defense
and
our
commanders
in
the
field
from
fully
and
swiftly
waging
battle
against
the
enemy
Micromanagement
from
Washington
DC
does
not
win
battles
They
are
won
in
the
field
drawing
upon
the
judgment
and
expertise
of
wartime
commanders
and
frontline
soldiers
acting
in
real
time
with
real
authority
and
with
a
clear
mission
to
defeat
the
enemy
Thats
why
we
will
also
expand
authority
for
American
armed
forces
to
target
the
terrorist
and
criminal
networks
that
sow
violence
and
chaos
throughout
Afghanistan
These
killers
need
to
know
they
have
nowhere
to
hide
that
no
place
is
beyond
the
reach
of
American
might
and
Americans
arms
Retribution
will
be
fast
and
powerful
As
we
lift
restrictions
and
expand
authorities
in
the
field
we
are
already
seeing
dramatic
results
in
the
campaign
to
defeat
ISIS
including
the
liberation
of
Mosul
in
Iraq
Since
my
inauguration
we
have
achieved
recordbreaking
success
in
that
regard
We
will
also
maximize
sanctions
and
other
financial
and
law
enforcement
actions
against
these
networks
to
eliminate
their
ability
to
export
terror
When
America
commits
its
warriors
to
battle
we
must
ensure
they
have
every
weapon
to
apply
swift
decisive
and
overwhelming
force
Our
troops
will
fight
to
win
We
will
fight
to
win
From
now
on
victory
will
have
a
clear
definition
attacking
our
enemies
obliterating
ISIS
crushing
alQaeda
preventing
the
Taliban
from
taking
over
Afghanistan
and
stopping
mass
terror
attacks
against
America
before
they
emerge
We
will
ask
our
NATO
allies
and
global
partners
to
support
our
new
strategy
with
additional
troop
and
funding
increases
in
line
with
our
own
We
are
confident
they
will
Since
taking
office
I
have
made
clear
that
our
allies
and
partners
must
contribute
much
more
money
to
our
collective
defense
and
they
have
done
so
In
this
struggle
the
heaviest
burden
will
continue
to
be
borne
by
the
good
people
of
Afghanistan
and
their
courageous
armed
forces
As
the
prime
minister
of
Afghanistan
has
promised
we
are
going
to
participate
in
economic
development
to
help
defray
the
cost
of
this
war
to
us
Afghanistan
is
fighting
to
defend
and
secure
their
country
against
the
same
enemies
who
threaten
us
The
stronger
the
Afghan
security
forces
become
the
less
we
will
have
to
do
Afghans
will
secure
and
build
their
own
nation
and
define
their
own
future
We
want
them
to
succeed
But
we
will
no
longer
use
American
military
might
to
construct
democracies
in
faraway
lands
or
try
to
rebuild
other
countries
in
our
own
image
Those
days
are
now
over
Instead
we
will
work
with
allies
and
partners
to
protect
our
shared
interests
We
are
not
asking
others
to
change
their
way
of
life
but
to
pursue
common
goals
that
allow
our
children
to
live
better
and
safer
lives
This
principled
realism
will
guide
our
decisions
moving
forward
Military
power
alone
will
not
bring
peace
to
Afghanistan
or
stop
the
terrorist
threat
arising
in
that
country
But
strategically
applied
force
aims
to
create
the
conditions
for
a
political
process
to
achieve
a
lasting
peace
America
will
work
with
the
Afghan
government
as
long
as
we
see
determination
and
progress
However
our
commitment
is
not
unlimited
and
our
support
is
not
a
blank
check
The
government
of
Afghanistan
must
carry
their
share
of
the
military
political
and
economic
burden
The
American
people
expect
to
see
real
reforms
real
progress
and
real
results
Our
patience
is
not
unlimited
We
will
keep
our
eyes
wide
open
In
abiding
by
the
oath
I
took
on
January
th
I
will
remain
steadfast
in
protecting
American
lives
and
American
interests
In
this
effort
we
will
make
common
cause
with
any
nation
that
chooses
to
stand
and
fight
alongside
us
against
this
global
threat
Terrorists
take
heed
America
will
never
let
up
until
you
are
dealt
a
lasting
defeat
Under
my
administration
many
billions
of
dollars
more
is
being
spent
on
our
military
And
this
includes
vast
amounts
being
spent
on
our
nuclear
arsenal
and
missile
defense
In
every
generation
we
have
faced
down
evil
and
we
have
always
prevailed
We
prevailed
because
we
know
who
we
are
and
what
we
are
fighting
for
Not
far
from
where
we
are
gathered
tonight
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Americas
greatest
patriots
lay
in
eternal
rest
at
Arlington
National
Cemetery
There
is
more
courage
sacrifice
and
love
in
those
hallowed
grounds
than
in
any
other
spot
on
the
face
of
the
Earth
Many
of
those
who
have
fought
and
died
in
Afghanistan
enlisted
in
the
months
after
September
th

They
volunteered
for
a
simple
reason
They
loved
America
and
they
were
determined
to
protect
her
Now
we
must
secure
the
cause
for
which
they
gave
their
lives
We
must
unite
to
defend
America
from
its
enemies
abroad
We
must
restore
the
bonds
of
loyalty
among
our
citizens
at
home
and
we
must
achieve
an
honorable
and
enduring
outcome
worthy
of
the
enormous
price
that
so
many
have
paid
Our
actions
and
in
the
months
to
come
all
of
them
will
honor
the
sacrifice
of
every
fallen
hero
every
family
who
lost
a
loved
one
and
every
wounded
warrior
who
shed
their
blood
in
defense
of
our
great
nation
With
our
resolve
we
will
ensure
that
your
service
and
that
your
families
will
bring
about
the
defeat
of
our
enemies
and
the
arrival
of
peace
We
will
push
onward
to
victory
with
power
in
our
hearts
courage
in
our
souls
and
everlasting
pride
in
each
and
every
one
of
you
Thank
you
May
God
bless
our
military
And
may
God
bless
the
United
States
of
America
Thank
you
very
much
Thank
you
Thank
you
very
much
Thats
so
nice
The
United
States
has
many
great
diplomats
but
there
is
truly
no
better
ambassador
for
our
country
than
our
beautiful
First
Lady
Melania
Thank
you
Melania
That
was
very
nice
Weve
come
to
your
nation
to
deliver
a
very
important
message
America
loves
Poland
and
America
loves
the
Polish
people
The
Poles
have
not
only
greatly
enriched
this
region
but
PolishAmericans
have
also
greatly
enriched
the
United
States
and
I
was
truly
proud
to
have
their
support
in
the

election
It
is
a
profound
honor
to
stand
in
this
city
by
this
monument
to
the
Warsaw
Uprising
and
to
address
the
Polish
nation
that
so
many
generations
have
dreamed
of
a
Poland
that
is
safe
strong
and
free
President
Duda
and
your
wonderful
First
Lady
Agata
have
welcomed
us
with
the
tremendous
warmth
and
kindness
for
which
Poland
is
known
around
the
world
Thank
you
My
sincere

and
I
mean
sincerely
thank
both
of
them
And
to
Prime
Minister
Szydlo
a
very
special
thanks
also
We
are
also
pleased
that
former
President
Lech
Walesa
so
famous
for
leading
the
Solidarity
Movement
has
joined
us
today
also
Thank
you
Thank
you
Thank
you
On
behalf
of
all
Americans
let
me
also
thank
the
entire
Polish
people
for
the
generosity
you
have
shown
in
welcoming
our
soldiers
to
your
country
These
soldiers
are
not
only
brave
defenders
of
freedom
but
also
symbols
of
Americas
commitment
to
your
security
and
your
place
in
a
strong
and
democratic
Europe
We
are
proudly
joined
on
stage
by
American
Polish
British
and
Romanian
soldiers
Thank
you
Thank
you
Great
job
President
Duda
and
I
have
just
come
from
an
incredibly
successful
meeting
with
the
leaders
participating
in
the
Three
Seas
Initiative
To
the
citizens
of
this
great
region
America
is
eager
to
expand
our
partnership
with
you
We
welcome
stronger
ties
of
trade
and
commerce
as
you
grow
your
economies
And
we
are
committed
to
securing
your
access
to
alternate
sources
of
energy
so
Poland
and
its
neighbors
are
never
again
held
hostage
to
a
single
supplier
of
energy
Mr
President
I
congratulate
you
along
with
the
President
of
Croatia
on
your
leadership
of
this
historic
Three
Seas
Initiative
Thank
you
This
is
my
first
visit
to
Central
Europe
as
President
and
I
am
thrilled
that
it
could
be
right
here
at
this
magnificent
beautiful
piece
of
land
It
is
beautiful
Poland
is
the
geographic
heart
of
Europe
but
more
importantly
in
the
Polish
people
we
see
the
soul
of
Europe
Your
nation
is
great
because
your
spirit
is
great
and
your
spirit
is
strong
For
two
centuries
Poland
suffered
constant
and
brutal
attacks
But
while
Poland
could
be
invaded
and
occupied
and
its
borders
even
erased
from
the
map
it
could
never
be
erased
from
history
or
from
your
hearts
In
those
dark
days
you
have
lost
your
land
but
you
never
lost
your
pride
So
it
is
with
true
admiration
that
I
can
say
today
that
from
the
farms
and
villages
of
your
countryside
to
the
cathedrals
and
squares
of
your
great
cities
Poland
lives
Poland
prospers
and
Poland
prevails
Despite
every
effort
to
transform
you
oppress
you
or
destroy
you
you
endured
and
overcame
You
are
the
proud
nation
of
Copernicus

think
of
that

Chopin
Saint
John
Paul
II
Poland
is
a
land
of
great
heroes
And
you
are
a
people
who
know
the
true
value
of
what
you
defend
The
triumph
of
the
Polish
spirit
over
centuries
of
hardship
gives
us
all
hope
for
a
future
in
which
good
conquers
evil
and
peace
achieves
victory
over
war
For
Americans
Poland
has
been
a
symbol
of
hope
since
the
beginning
of
our
nation
Polish
heroes
and
American
patriots
fought
side
by
side
in
our
War
of
Independence
and
in
many
wars
that
followed
Our
soldiers
still
serve
together
today
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
combating
the
enemies
of
all
civilization
For
Americas
part
we
have
never
given
up
on
freedom
and
independence
as
the
right
and
destiny
of
the
Polish
people
and
we
never
ever
will
Our
two
countries
share
a
special
bond
forged
by
unique
histories
and
national
characters
Its
a
fellowship
that
exists
only
among
people
who
have
fought
and
bled
and
died
for
freedom
The
signs
of
this
friendship
stand
in
our
nations
capital
Just
steps
from
the
White
House
weve
raised
statues
of
men
with
names
like
Puaski
and
Kociuszko
The
same
is
true
in
Warsaw
where
street
signs
carry
the
name
of
George
Washington
and
a
monument
stands
to
one
of
the
worlds
greatest
heroes
Ronald
Reagan
And
so
I
am
here
today
not
just
to
visit
an
old
ally
but
to
hold
it
up
as
an
example
for
others
who
seek
freedom
and
who
wish
to
summon
the
courage
and
the
will
to
defend
our
civilization
The
story
of
Poland
is
the
story
of
a
people
who
have
never
lost
hope
who
have
never
been
broken
and
who
have
never
ever
forgotten
who
they
are
This
is
a
nation
more
than
one
thousand
years
old
Your
borders
were
erased
for
more
than
a
century
and
only
restored
just
one
century
ago
In

in
the
Miracle
of
Vistula
Poland
stopped
the
Soviet
army
bent
on
European
conquest
Then

years
later
in

you
were
invaded
yet
again
this
time
by
Nazi
Germany
from
the
west
and
the
Soviet
Union
from
the
east
Thats
trouble
Thats
tough
Under
a
double
occupation
the
Polish
people
endured
evils
beyond
description
the
Katyn
forest
massacre
the
occupations
the
Holocaust
the
Warsaw
Ghetto
and
the
Warsaw
Ghetto
Uprising
the
destruction
of
this
beautiful
capital
city
and
the
deaths
of
nearly
one
in
five
Polish
people
A
vibrant
Jewish
population

the
largest
in
Europe

was
reduced
to
almost
nothing
after
the
Nazis
systematically
murdered
millions
of
Polands
Jewish
citizens
along
with
countless
others
during
that
brutal
occupation
In
the
summer
of

the
Nazi
and
Soviet
armies
were
preparing
for
a
terrible
and
bloody
battle
right
here
in
Warsaw
Amid
that
hell
on
earth
the
citizens
of
Poland
rose
up
to
defend
their
homeland
I
am
deeply
honored
to
be
joined
on
stage
today
by
veterans
and
heroes
of
the
Warsaw
Uprising
What
great
spirit
We
salute
your
noble
sacrifice
and
we
pledge
to
always
remember
your
fight
for
Poland
and
for
freedom
Thank
you
Thank
you
This
monument
reminds
us
that
more
than

Poles
died
during
that
desperate
struggle
to
overthrow
oppression
From
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
Soviet
armed
forces
stopped
and
waited
They
watched
as
the
Nazis
ruthlessly
destroyed
the
city
viciously
murdering
men
women
and
children
They
tried
to
destroy
this
nation
forever
by
shattering
its
will
to
survive
But
there
is
a
courage
and
a
strength
deep
in
the
Polish
character
that
no
one
could
destroy
The
Polish
martyr
Bishop
Michael
Kozal
said
it
well
More
horrifying
than
a
defeat
of
arms
is
a
collapse
of
the
human
spirit
Through
four
decades
of
communist
rule
Poland
and
the
other
captive
nations
of
Europe
endured
a
brutal
campaign
to
demolish
freedom
your
faith
your
laws
your
history
your
identity

indeed
the
very
essence
of
your
culture
and
your
humanity
Yet
through
it
all
you
never
lost
that
spirit
Your
oppressors
tried
to
break
you
but
Poland
could
not
be
broken
And
when
the
day
came
on
June
nd

and
one
million
Poles
gathered
around
Victory
Square
for
their
very
first
mass
with
their
Polish
Pope
that
day
every
communist
in
Warsaw
must
have
known
that
their
oppressive
system
would
soon
come
crashing
down
They
must
have
known
it
at
the
exact
moment
during
Pope
John
Paul
IIs
sermon
when
a
million
Polish
men
women
and
children
suddenly
raised
their
voices
in
a
single
prayer
A
million
Polish
people
did
not
ask
for
wealth
They
did
not
ask
for
privilege
Instead
one
million
Poles
sang
three
simple
words
We
Want
God
In
those
words
the
Polish
people
recalled
the
promise
of
a
better
future
They
found
new
courage
to
face
down
their
oppressors
and
they
found
the
words
to
declare
that
Poland
would
be
Poland
once
again
As
I
stand
here
today
before
this
incredible
crowd
this
faithful
nation
we
can
still
hear
those
voices
that
echo
through
history
Their
message
is
as
true
today
as
ever
The
people
of
Poland
the
people
of
America
and
the
people
of
Europe
still
cry
out
We
want
God
Together
with
Pope
John
Paul
II
the
Poles
reasserted
their
identity
as
a
nation
devoted
to
God
And
with
that
powerful
declaration
of
who
you
are
you
came
to
understand
what
to
do
and
how
to
live
You
stood
in
solidarity
against
oppression
against
a
lawless
secret
police
against
a
cruel
and
wicked
system
that
impoverished
your
cities
and
your
souls
And
you
won
Poland
prevailed
Poland
will
always
prevail
You
were
supported
in
that
victory
over
communism
by
a
strong
alliance
of
free
nations
in
the
West
that
defied
tyranny
Now
among
the
most
committed
members
of
the
NATO
Alliance
Poland
has
resumed
its
place
as
a
leading
nation
of
a
Europe
that
is
strong
whole
and
free
A
strong
Poland
is
a
blessing
to
the
nations
of
Europe
and
they
know
that
A
strong
Europe
is
a
blessing
to
the
West
and
to
the
world
One
hundred
years
after
the
entry
of
American
forces
into
World
War
I
the
transatlantic
bond
between
the
United
States
and
Europe
is
as
strong
as
ever
and
maybe
in
many
ways
even
stronger
This
continent
no
longer
confronts
the
specter
of
communism
But
today
were
in
the
West
and
we
have
to
say
there
are
dire
threats
to
our
security
and
to
our
way
of
life
You
see
whats
happening
out
there
They
are
threats
We
will
confront
them
We
will
win
But
they
are
threats
We
are
confronted
by
another
oppressive
ideology

one
that
seeks
to
export
terrorism
and
extremism
all
around
the
globe
America
and
Europe
have
suffered
one
terror
attack
after
another
Were
going
to
get
it
to
stop
During
a
historic
gathering
in
Saudi
Arabia
I
called
on
the
leaders
of
more
than

Muslim
nations
to
join
together
to
drive
out
this
menace
which
threatens
all
of
humanity
We
must
stand
united
against
these
shared
enemies
to
strip
them
of
their
territory
and
their
funding
and
their
networks
and
any
form
of
ideological
support
that
they
may
have
While
we
will
always
welcome
new
citizens
who
share
our
values
and
love
our
people
our
borders
will
always
be
closed
to
terrorism
and
extremism
of
any
kind
We
are
fighting
hard
against
radical
Islamic
terrorism
and
we
will
prevail
We
cannot
accept
those
who
reject
our
values
and
who
use
hatred
to
justify
violence
against
the
innocent
Today
the
West
is
also
confronted
by
the
powers
that
seek
to
test
our
will
undermine
our
confidence
and
challenge
our
interests
To
meet
new
forms
of
aggression
including
propaganda
financial
crimes
and
cyberwarfare
we
must
adapt
our
alliance
to
compete
effectively
in
new
ways
and
on
all
new
battlefields
We
urge
Russia
to
cease
its
destabilizing
activities
in
Ukraine
and
elsewhere
and
its
support
for
hostile
regimes

including
Syria
and
Iran

and
to
instead
join
the
community
of
responsible
nations
in
our
fight
against
common
enemies
and
in
defense
of
civilization
itself
Finally
on
both
sides
of
the
Atlantic
our
citizens
are
confronted
by
yet
another
danger

one
firmly
within
our
control
This
danger
is
invisible
to
some
but
familiar
to
the
Poles
the
steady
creep
of
government
bureaucracy
that
drains
the
vitality
and
wealth
of
the
people
The
West
became
great
not
because
of
paperwork
and
regulations
but
because
people
were
allowed
to
chase
their
dreams
and
pursue
their
destinies
Americans
Poles
and
the
nations
of
Europe
value
individual
freedom
and
sovereignty
We
must
work
together
to
confront
forces
whether
they
come
from
inside
or
out
from
the
South
or
the
East
that
threaten
over
time
to
undermine
these
values
and
to
erase
the
bonds
of
culture
faith
and
tradition
that
make
us
who
we
are
If
left
unchecked
these
forces
will
undermine
our
courage
sap
our
spirit
and
weaken
our
will
to
defend
ourselves
and
our
societies
But
just
as
our
adversaries
and
enemies
of
the
past
learned
here
in
Poland
we
know
that
these
forces
too
are
doomed
to
fail
if
we
want
them
to
fail
And
we
do
indeed
want
them
to
fail
They
are
doomed
not
only
because
our
alliance
is
strong
our
countries
are
resilient
and
our
power
is
unmatched
Through
all
of
that
you
have
to
say
everything
is
true
Our
adversaries
however
are
doomed
because
we
will
never
forget
who
we
are
And
if
we
dont
forget
who
are
we
just
cant
be
beaten
Americans
will
never
forget
The
nations
of
Europe
will
never
forget
We
are
the
fastest
and
the
greatest
community
There
is
nothing
like
our
community
of
nations
The
world
has
never
known
anything
like
our
community
of
nations
We
write
symphonies
We
pursue
innovation
We
celebrate
our
ancient
heroes
embrace
our
timeless
traditions
and
customs
and
always
seek
to
explore
and
discover
brandnew
frontiers
We
reward
brilliance
We
strive
for
excellence
and
cherish
inspiring
works
of
art
that
honor
God
We
treasure
the
rule
of
law
and
protect
the
right
to
free
speech
and
free
expression
We
empower
women
as
pillars
of
our
society
and
of
our
success
We
put
faith
and
family
not
government
and
bureaucracy
at
the
center
of
our
lives
And
we
debate
everything
We
challenge
everything
We
seek
to
know
everything
so
that
we
can
better
know
ourselves
And
above
all
we
value
the
dignity
of
every
human
life
protect
the
rights
of
every
person
and
share
the
hope
of
every
soul
to
live
in
freedom
That
is
who
we
are
Those
are
the
priceless
ties
that
bind
us
together
as
nations
as
allies
and
as
a
civilization
What
we
have
what
we
inherited
from
our

and
you
know
this
better
than
anybody
and
you
see
it
today
with
this
incredible
group
of
people

what
weve
inherited
from
our
ancestors
has
never
existed
to
this
extent
before
And
if
we
fail
to
preserve
it
it
will
never
ever
exist
again
So
we
cannot
fail
This
great
community
of
nations
has
something
else
in
common
In
every
one
of
them
it
is
the
people
not
the
powerful
who
have
always
formed
the
foundation
of
freedom
and
the
cornerstone
of
our
defense
The
people
have
been
that
foundation
here
in
Poland

as
they
were
right
here
in
Warsaw

and
they
were
the
foundation
from
the
very
very
beginning
in
America
Our
citizens
did
not
win
freedom
together
did
not
survive
horrors
together
did
not
face
down
evil
together
only
to
lose
our
freedom
to
a
lack
of
pride
and
confidence
in
our
values
We
did
not
and
we
will
not
We
will
never
back
down
As
long
as
we
know
our
history
we
will
know
how
to
build
our
future
Americans
know
that
a
strong
alliance
of
free
sovereign
and
independent
nations
is
the
best
defense
for
our
freedoms
and
for
our
interests
That
is
why
my
administration
has
demanded
that
all
members
of
NATO
finally
meet
their
full
and
fair
financial
obligation
As
a
result
of
this
insistence
billions
of
dollars
more
have
begun
to
pour
into
NATO
In
fact
people
are
shocked
But
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
more
are
coming
in
from
countries
that
in
my
opinion
would
not
have
been
paying
so
quickly
To
those
who
would
criticize
our
tough
stance
I
would
point
out
that
the
United
States
has
demonstrated
not
merely
with
words
but
with
its
actions
that
we
stand
firmly
behind
Article

the
mutual
defense
commitment
Words
are
easy
but
actions
are
what
matters
And
for
its
own
protection

and
you
know
this
everybody
knows
this
everybody
has
to
know
this

Europe
must
do
more
Europe
must
demonstrate
that
it
believes
in
its
future
by
investing
its
money
to
secure
that
future
That
is
why
we
applaud
Poland
for
its
decision
to
move
forward
this
week
on
acquiring
from
the
United
States
the
battletested
Patriot
air
and
missile
defense
system

the
best
anywhere
in
the
world
That
is
also
why
we
salute
the
Polish
people
for
being
one
of
the
NATO
countries
that
has
actually
achieved
the
benchmark
for
investment
in
our
common
defense
Thank
you
Thank
you
Poland
I
must
tell
you
the
example
you
set
is
truly
magnificent
and
we
applaud
Poland
Thank
you
We
have
to
remember
that
our
defense
is
not
just
a
commitment
of
money
it
is
a
commitment
of
will
Because
as
the
Polish
experience
reminds
us
the
defense
of
the
West
ultimately
rests
not
only
on
means
but
also
on
the
will
of
its
people
to
prevail
and
be
successful
and
get
what
you
have
to
have
The
fundamental
question
of
our
time
is
whether
the
West
has
the
will
to
survive
Do
we
have
the
confidence
in
our
values
to
defend
them
at
any
cost
Do
we
have
enough
respect
for
our
citizens
to
protect
our
borders
Do
we
have
the
desire
and
the
courage
to
preserve
our
civilization
in
the
face
of
those
who
would
subvert
and
destroy
it
We
can
have
the
largest
economies
and
the
most
lethal
weapons
anywhere
on
Earth
but
if
we
do
not
have
strong
families
and
strong
values
then
we
will
be
weak
and
we
will
not
survive
If
anyone
forgets
the
critical
importance
of
these
things
let
them
come
to
one
country
that
never
has
Let
them
come
to
Poland
And
let
them
come
here
to
Warsaw
and
learn
the
story
of
the
Warsaw
Uprising
When
they
do
they
should
learn
about
Jerusalem
Avenue
In
August
of

Jerusalem
Avenue
was
one
of
the
main
roads
running
east
and
west
through
this
city
just
as
it
is
today
Control
of
that
road
was
crucially
important
to
both
sides
in
the
battle
for
Warsaw
The
German
military
wanted
it
as
their
most
direct
route
to
move
troops
and
to
form
a
very
strong
front
And
for
the
Polish
Home
Army
the
ability
to
pass
north
and
south
across
that
street
was
critical
to
keep
the
center
of
the
city
and
the
Uprising
itself
from
being
split
apart
and
destroyed
Every
night
the
Poles
put
up
sandbags
amid
machine
gun
fire

and
it
was
horrendous
fire

to
protect
a
narrow
passage
across
Jerusalem
Avenue
Every
day
the
enemy
forces
knocked
them
down
again
and
again
and
again
Then
the
Poles
dug
a
trench
Finally
they
built
a
barricade
And
the
brave
Polish
fighters
began
to
flow
across
Jerusalem
Avenue
That
narrow
passageway
just
a
few
feet
wide
was
the
fragile
link
that
kept
the
Uprising
alive
Between
its
walls
a
constant
stream
of
citizens
and
freedom
fighters
made
their
perilous
just
perilous
sprints
They
ran
across
that
street
they
ran
through
that
street
they
ran
under
that
street

all
to
defend
this
city
The
far
side
was
several
yards
away
recalled
one
young
Polish
woman
named
Greta
That
mortality
and
that
life
was
so
important
to
her
In
fact
she
said
The
mortally
dangerous
sector
of
the
street
was
soaked
in
the
blood
It
was
the
blood
of
messengers
liaison
girls
and
couriers
Nazi
snipers
shot
at
anybody
who
crossed
Anybody
who
crossed
they
were
being
shot
at
Their
soldiers
burned
every
building
on
the
street
and
they
used
the
Poles
as
human
shields
for
their
tanks
in
their
effort
to
capture
Jerusalem
Avenue
The
enemy
never
ceased
its
relentless
assault
on
that
small
outpost
of
civilization
And
the
Poles
never
ceased
its
defense
The
Jerusalem
Avenue
passage
required
constant
protection
repair
and
reinforcement
but
the
will
of
its
defenders
did
not
waver
even
in
the
face
of
death
And
to
the
last
days
of
the
Uprising
the
fragile
crossing
never
ever
failed
It
was
never
ever
forgotten
It
was
kept
open
by
the
Polish
people
The
memories
of
those
who
perished
in
the
Warsaw
Uprising
cry
out
across
the
decades
and
few
are
clearer
than
the
memories
of
those
who
died
to
build
and
defend
the
Jerusalem
Avenue
crossing
Those
heroes
remind
us
that
the
West
was
saved
with
the
blood
of
patriots
that
each
generation
must
rise
up
and
play
their
part
in
its
defense
and
that
every
foot
of
ground
and
every
last
inch
of
civilization
is
worth
defending
with
your
life
Our
own
fight
for
the
West
does
not
begin
on
the
battlefield

it
begins
with
our
minds
our
wills
and
our
souls
Today
the
ties
that
unite
our
civilization
are
no
less
vital
and
demand
no
less
defense
than
that
bare
shred
of
land
on
which
the
hope
of
Poland
once
totally
rested
Our
freedom
our
civilization
and
our
survival
depend
on
these
bonds
of
history
culture
and
memory
And
today
as
ever
Poland
is
in
our
heart
and
its
people
are
in
that
fight
Just
as
Poland
could
not
be
broken
I
declare
today
for
the
world
to
hear
that
the
West
will
never
ever
be
broken
Our
values
will
prevail
Our
people
will
thrive
And
our
civilization
will
triumph
So
together
let
us
all
fight
like
the
Poles

for
family
for
freedom
for
country
and
for
God
Thank
you
God
Bless
You
God
bless
the
Polish
people
God
bless
our
allies
And
God
bless
the
United
States
of
America
Thank
you
God
bless
you
Thank
you
very
much
Thank
you
everybody
Thank
you
very
much
I
am
thrilled
to
be
here
Thrilled

that

an
easy
trip
youre
wrong
But
I

thrilled
th
Boy
Scout
Jamboree
wow
and
to
address
such
a
tremendous
group
Boy

a
lot
of
people

The
press

its
about

It
looks
like
about

people
You
set
a
record
today
You
set
a
record
Thats
a
great
honor
believe
me
Tonight
we
put
aside
all
of
the
policy
fights
in
Washington
DC
youve
been
hearing
about
with
the
fake
news
and
all
of
that
Were
going
to
put
that
Were
going
to
put
that
aside
And
instead
were
going
to
talk
about
success
about
how
all
of
you
amazing
young
Scouts
can
achieve
your
dreams
what
to
think
of
what
Ive
been
thinking
about
You
want
to
achieve
your
dreams
I
said
who
the
hell
wants
to
speak
about
politics
when
Im
in
front
of
the
Boy
Scouts
Right
There
are
many
great
honors
that
come
with
the
job
of
being
president
of
the
United
States
But
looking
out
at
this
incredible
gathering
of
mostly
young
patriots
Mostly
young
Im
especially
proud
to
speak
to
you
as
the
honorary
president
of
the
Boy
Scouts
of
America
You
are
the
young
people
of
character
integrity
who
will
serve
as
leaders
of
our
communities
and
uphold
the
sacred
values
of
our
nation
I
want
to
thank
Boy
Scouts
President
Randall
Stephenson
chief
Scout
executive
Michael
Surbaugh
Jamboree
Chairman
Ralph
de
la
Vega
and
the
thousands
of
volunteers
who
made
this
a
lifechanging
experience
for
all
of
you
And
when
they
asked
me
to
be
here
I
said
absolutely
yes
Finally

and
we
cant
forgot
these
people

I
especially
want
to
salute
the
moms
and
the
dads
and
troop
leaders
who
are
here
tonight
Thank
you
for
making
scouting
possible
Thank
you
mom
and
dad
troop
leaders
When
you
volunteer
for
the
Boy
Scouts
you
are
not
only
shaping
young
lives
you
are
shaping
the
future
of
America
The
United
States
has
no
better
citizens
than
its
Boy
Scouts
No
better
The
values
traditions
and
skills
you
learn
here
will
serve
you
throughout
your
lives
And
just
as
importantly
they
will
serve
your
families
your
cities
and
in
the
future
and
in
the
present
will
serve
your
country
The
Scouts
believe
in
putting
America
first
You
know
I
go
to
Washington
and
I
see
all
these
politicians
and
I
see
the
swamp
and
its
not
a
good
place
In
fact
today
I
said
we
ought
to
change
it
from
the
word
swamp
to
the
word
cesspool
or
perhaps
to
the
word
sewer
But
its
not
good
Not
good
And
I
see
whats
going
on
And
believe
me
Id
much
rather
be
with
you
that
I
can
tell
you
Ill
tell
you
the
reason
that
I
love
this
and
the
reason
that
I
really
wanted
to
be
here
is
because
as
president
I
rely
on
former
Boy
Scouts
every
single
day
And
so
do
the
American
people
Its
amazing
how
many
Boy
Scouts
we
have
at
the
highest
level
of
our
great
government
Many
of
my
top
advisers
in
the
White
House
were
Scouts
Ten
members
of
my
cabinet
were
Scouts
Can
you
believe
that
Ten
Secretary
of
State
Rex
Tillerson
is
not
only
a
Boy
Scout
he
is
your
former
national
president
The
vice
president
of
the
United
States
Mike
Pence

a
good
guy

was
a
Scout
and
it
meant
so
much
to
him
Some
of
you
here
tonight
might
even
have
camped
out
in
this
yard
when
Mike
was
the
governor
of
Indiana
but
the
scouting
was
very
very
important
And
by
the
way
where
are
our
Indiana
scouts
tonight
I
wonder
if
the
television
cameras
will
follow
you
They
dont
doing
that
when
they
see
these
massive
crowds
They
dont
like
doing
that
Hi

lot
of
love

this
big
beautiful
place
A

of

of
love
for
our

fantastic
job
He
makes
sure
that

leave
our
national
parks

federal
lands
better
than

them

the
best
scouting
tradition
So

millions
of
Americans
strong
and

of
Health
and
Human
Services
And

a
great
job
And
hopefully

to
start
our
path
toward

this
horrible
thing
known

By
the
way

He

the
other
senators
to
vote

it
Its

You
know
after
seven
years
of
saying
repeal
and
replace
Obamacare
we
have
a
chance
to
now
do
it
They
better
do
it
Hopefully
theyll
do
it
As
we
can
see
just
by
looking
at
our
government
in
America
Scouts
lead
the
way
And
another
thing
Ive
noticed

and
Ive
noticed
it
all
my
life

there
is
a
tremendous
spirit
with
being
a
Scout
more
so
than
almost
anything
I
can
think
of
So
whatever
is
going
on
keep
doing
it
Its
incredible
to
watch
believe
me
Each
of
these
leaders
will
tell
that
you
their
road
to
American
success

and
you
have
to
understand

their
American
success
and
they
are
a
great
great
story
was
paved
with
the
patriotic
American
values
and
traditions
they
learned
in
the
Boy
Scouts
And
some
day
many
years
from
now
when
you
look
back
on
all
of
the
adventures
in
your
lives
you
will
be
able
to
say
the
same
I
got
my
start
as
a
Scout
just
like
these
incredibly
great
people
that
are
doing
such
a
good
job
for
our
country
So
thats
going
to
happen
Boy
Scout
values
are
American
values
And
great
Boy
Scouts
become
great
great
Americans
As
the
Scout
law
says
a
scout
is
trustworthy
loyal

we
could
use
some
more
loyalty
I
will
tell
that
you
that
That
was
very
impressive
Youve
heard
that
before
But
here
you
learn
the
rewards
of
hard
work
and
perseverance
never
ever
give
up
Never
quit
Persevere
Never
ever
quit
You
learn
the
satisfaction
of
building
a
roaring
campfire
reaching
a
mountain
summit
or
earning
a
merit
badge
after
mastering
a
certain
skill
Theres
no
better
feeling
than
an
achievement
that
youve
earned
with
your
own
sweat
tears
resolve
hard
work
Theres
nothing
like
it
Do
you
agree
with
that
Im
waving
to
people
back
there
so
small
I
cant
even
see
them
Man
this
is
a
lot
of
people
Turn
those
cameras
back
there
please
That
is
so
incredible
By
the
way
what
do
you
think
the
chances
are
that
this
incredible
massive
crowd
record
setting
is
going
to
be
shown
on
television
tonight
One
percent
or
zero
The
fake
media
will
say
President
Trump
spoke

you
know
what
is

President
Trump
spoke
before
a
small
crowd
of
Boy
Scouts
today
Thats
some

that
is
some
crowd
Fake
media
Fake
news
Thank
you
And
Im
honored
by
that
By
the
way
all
of
you
people
that
cant
even
see
you
so
thank
you
I
hope
you
can
hear
Through
scouting
you
also
learned
to
believe
in
yourself

so
important

to
have
confidence
in
your
ability
and
to
take
responsibility
for
your
own
life
When
you
face
down
new
challenges

and
you
will
have
plenty
of
them

develop
talents
you
never
thought
possible
and
lead
your
teammates
through
daring
trials
you
discover
that
you
can
handle
anything
And
you
learn
it
by
being
a
Scout
Its
great
You
can
do
anything
You
can
be
anything
you
want
to
be
But
in
order
to
succeed
you
must
find
out
what
you
love
to
do
You
have
to
find
your
passion
no
matter
what
they
tell
you
If
you
dont

I
love
you
too
I
dont
know
Nice
guy
Hey
what
am
I
going
to
do
He
sounds
like
a
nice
person
He

he
he
he
I
do
I
do
love
you
By
the
way
just
a
question
did
President
Obama
ever
come
to
a
Jamboree
And
well
be
back
Well
be
back
The
answer
is
no
But
well
be
back
In
life
in
order
to
be
successful

and
you
people
are
well
on
the
road
to
success

you
have
to
find
out
what
makes
you
excited
what
makes
you
want
to
get
up
each
morning
and
go
to
work
You
have
to
find
it
If
you
love
what
you
do
and
dedicate
yourself
to
your
work
then
you
will
gain
momentum
And
look
you
have
to
You
need
the
word
momentum
You
will
gain
that
momentum
And
each
success
will
create
another
success
The
word
momentum
Ill
tell
you
a
story
thats
very
interesting
for
me
When
I
was
young
there
was
a
man
named
William
Levitt
You
have
some
here
You
have
some
in
different
states
Anybody
ever
hear
of
Levittown
And
he
was
a
very
successful
man
became
unbelievable

he
was
a
home
builder
became
an
unbelievable
success
and
got
more
and
more
successful
And
hed
build
homes
and
at
night
hed
go
to
these
major
sites
with
teams
of
people
and
hed
scour
the
sites
for
nails
and
sawdust
and
small
pieces
of
wood
and
they
cleaned
the
site
so
when
the
workers
came
in
the
next
morning
the
sites
would
be
spotless
and
clean
and
he
did
it
properly
And
he
did
this
for

years
and
then
he
was
offered
a
lot
of
money
for
his
company
and
he
sold
his
company
for
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
at
the
time
especially
This
is
a
long
time
ago
Sold
his
company
for
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
And
he
went
out
and
bought
a
big
yacht
and
he
had
a
very
interesting
life
I
wont
go
any
more
than
that
because
youre
Boy
Scouts
so
Im
not
going
to
tell
you
what
he
did
Should
I
tell
you
Should
I
tell
you
Youre
Boy
Scouts
but
you
know
life
You
know
life
So
look
at
you
Who
would
think
this
is
the
Boy
Scouts
right
So
he
had
a
very
very
interesting
life
and
the
company
that
bought
his
company
was
a
big
conglomerate
and
they
didnt
know
anything
about
building
homes
and
they
didnt
know
anything
about
picking
up
the
nails
and
the
sawdust
and
selling
it
and
the
scraps
of
wood
This
was
a
big
conglomerate
based
in
New
York
City
And
after
about
a
year
period
there
were
losing
a
lot
with
it
It
didnt
mean
anything
to
them
And
they
couldnt
sell
it
So
they
called
William
Levitt
up
and
they
said
would
you
like
to
buy
back
your
company
and
he
said
yes
I
would
He
so
badly
wanted
it
He
got
bored
with
this
life
of
yachts
and
sailing
and
all
of
the
things
he
did
in
the
south
of
France
and
other
places
You
wont
get
bored
right
You
know
truthfully
youre
workers
Youll
get
bored
too
believe
me
Of
course
having
a
few
good
years
like
that
isnt
so
bad
But
what
happened
is
he
bought
back
his
company
and
he
bought
back
a
lot
of
empty
land
and
he
worked
hard
at
getting
zoning
and
he
worked
hard
on
starting
to
develop
and
in
the
end
he
failed
and
he
failed
badly
lost
all
of
his
money
He
went
personally
bankrupt
and
he
was
now
much
older
And
I
saw
him
at
a
cocktail
party
And
it
was
very
sad
because
the
hottest
people
in
New
York
were
at
this
party
It
was
the
party
of
Steve
Ross

Steve
Ross
who
was
one
of
the
great
people
He
came
up
and
discovered
really
founded
Time
Warner
and
he
was
a
great
guy
He
had
a
lot
of
successful
people
at
the
party
And
I
was
doing
well
so
I
got
invited
to
the
party
I
was
very
young
And
I
go
in
but
Im
in
the
real
estate
business
and
I
see
a
hundred
people
some
of
whom
I
recognize
and
theyre
big
in
the
entertainment
business
And
I
see
sitting
in
the
corner
was
a
little
old
man
who
was
all
by
himself
Nobody
was
talking
to
him
I
immediately
recognized
that
that
man
was
the
once
great
William
Levitt
of
Levittown
and
I
immediately
went
over
I
wanted
to
talk
to
him
more
than
the
Hollywood
show
business
communications
people
So
I
went
over
and
talked
to
him
and
I
said
Mr
Levitt
Im
Donald
Trump
He
said
I
know
I
said
Mr
Levitt
how
are
you
doing
He
goes
Not
well
not
well
at
all
And
I
knew
that
But
he
said
Not
well
at
all
And
he
explained
what
was
happening
and
how
bad
its
been
and
how
hard
its
been
And
I
said
What
exactly
happened
Why
did
this
happen
to
you
Youre
one
of
the
greats
ever
in
our
industry
Why
did
this
happen
to
you
And
he
said
Donald
I
lost
my
momentum
I
lost
my
momentum
A
word
you
never
hear
when
youre
talking
about
success
when
some
of
these
guys
that
never
made

cents
theyre
on
television
giving
you
things
about
how
youre
going
to
be
successful
and
the
only
thing
they
ever
did
was
a
book
and
a
tape
But
I
tell
you

Ill
tell
you
it
was
very
sad
and
I
never
forgot
that
moment
And
I
thought
about
it
and
its
exactly
true
He
lost
his
momentum
meaning
he
took
this
period
of
time
off
long
years
and
then
when
he
got
back
he
didnt
have
that
same
momentum
In
life
I
always
tell
this
to
people
you
have
to
know
whether
or
not
you
continue
to
have
the
momentum
And
if
you
dont
have
it
thats
OK
Because
youre
going
to
go
on
and
youre
going
to
learn
and
youre
going
to
do
things
that
are
great
But
you
have
to
know
about
the
word
momentum
But
the
big
thing
never
quit
never
give
up
do
something
you
love
When
you
do
something
you
love
as
a
Scout
I
see
that
you
love
it
But
when
you
do
something
that
you
love
youll
never
fail
What
youre
going
to
do
is
give
it
a
shot
again
and
again
and
again
Youre
ultimately
going
to
be
successful
And
remember
this
youre
not
working
Because
when
youre
doing
something
that
you
love
like
I
do

of
course
I
love
my
business
but
this
is
a
little
bit
different
Who
thought
this
was
going
to
happen
Were
you
know
having
a
good
time
Were
doing
a
good
job
Doing
a
good
job
But
when
you
do
something
that
you
love
remember
this
its
not
work
So
youll
work

Youre
going
to
work
all
the
time
And
at
the
end
of
the
year
youre
not
really
working
You
dont
think
of
it
as
work
When
youre
not
doing
something
that
you
like
or
when
youre
forced
into
do
something
that
you
really
dont
like
thats
called
work
and
its
hard
work
and
tedious
work
So
as
much
as
you
can
do
something
that
you
love
work
hard
and
never
ever
give
up
and
youre
going
to
be
tremendously
successful
tremendously
successful
Now
with
that
I
have
to
tell
you
our
economy
is
doing
great
Our
stock
market
has
picked
up
since
the
election
November
th

do
we
remember
that
day
Was
that
a
beautiful
day
What
a
day
Do
you
remember
that
famous
night
on
television
November
th
where
they
said
these
dishonest
people
where
they
said
there
is
no
path
to
victory
for
Donald
Trump
They
forgot
about
the
forgotten
people
By
the
way
theyre
not
forgetting
about
the
forgotten
people
anymore
Theyre
going
crazy
trying
to
figure
it
out
but
I
told
them
far
too
late
its
far
too
late
But
you
remember
that
incredible
night
with
the
maps
and
the
Republicans
are
red
and
the
Democrats
are
blue
and
that
map
was
so
red
it
was
unbelievable
And
they
didnt
know
what
to
say
And
you
know
we
have
a
tremendous
disadvantage
in
the
Electoral
College
Popular
vote
is
much
easier
We
have

because
New
York
California
Illinois
you
have
to
practically
run
the
East
Coast
And
we
did
We
won
Florida
We
won
South
Carolina
We
won
North
Carolina
We
won
Pennsylvania
We
won
and
won
So
when
they
said
there
is
no
way
to
victory
there
is
no
way
to

You
know
I
went
to
Maine
four
times
because
its
one
vote
and
we
won
We
won
One
vote
I
went
there
because
I
kept
hearing
were
at

But
then
Wisconsin
came
in
Many
many
years
Michigan
came
in
So

and
we
worked
hard
there
You
know
my
opponent
didnt
work
hard
there
because
she
was
told
She
was
told
she
was
going
to
win
Michigan
and
I
said
well
wait
a
minute
The
car
industry
is
moving
to
Mexico
Why
is
she
going
to
move

shes
there
Why
are
they
allowing
it
to
move
And
by
the
way
do
you
see
those
car
industry

do
you
see
whats
happening
Theyre
coming
back
to
Michigan
Theyre
coming
back
to
Ohio
Theyre
starting
to
peel
back
in
And
we
go
to
Wisconsin
now
Wisconsin
hadnt
been
won
in
many
many
years
by
a
Republican
But
we
go
to
Wisconsin
and
we
had
tremendous
crowds
And
Id
leave
these
massive
crowds
Id
say
why
are
we
going
to
lose
this
state
The
polls
thats
also
fake
news
Theyre
fake
polls
But
the
polls
are
saying

but
we
won
Wisconsin
So
I
have
to
tell
you
what
we
did
in
all
fairness
is
an
unbelievable
tribute
to
you
and
all
of
the
other
millions
and
millions
of
people
that
came
out
and
voted
for
make
America
great
again
And
Ill
tell
you
what
we
are
indeed
making
America
great
again
And
Ill
tell
you
what
we
are
indeed
making
America
great
again
Whats
going
on
is
incredible
We
had
the
best
jobs
report
in

years
The
stock
market
on
a
daily
basis
is
hitting
an
alltime
high
Were
going
to
be
bringing
back
very
soon
trillions
of
dollars
from
companies
that
cant
get
their
money
back
into
this
country
and
that
money
is
going
to
be
used
to
help
rebuild
America
Were
doing
things
that
nobody
ever
thought
was
possible
and
weve
just
started
Its
just
the
beginning
believe
me
You
know
in
the
Boy
Scouts
you
learn
right
from
wrong
correct
You
learn
to
contribute
to
your
communities
to
take
pride
in
your
nation
and
to
seek
out
opportunities
to
serve
You
pledge
to
help
other
people
at
all
times
In
the
Scout
oath
you
pledge
on
your
honor
to
do
your
best
and
to
do
your
duty
to
God
and
your
country
And
by
the
way
under
the
Trump
administration
youll
be
saying
Merry
Christmas
again
when
you
go
shopping
believe
me
Merry
Christmas
Theyve
been
downplaying
that
little
beautiful
phrase
Youre
going
to
be
saying
Merry
Christmas
again
folks
But
the
words
duty
country
and
God
are
beautiful
words
In
other
words
basically
what
youre
doing
is
youre
pledging
to
be
a
great
American
patriot
For
more
than
a
century
that
is
exactly
what
our
Boy
Scouts
have
been
Last
year
you
gave
more
than

million
hours
of
service
to
helping
people
in
your
communities
Incredible
Thats
an
incredible
stat
All
of
you
here
tonight
will
contribute
more
than

hours
of
service
by
the
end
of
this
Jamboree


When
natural
disaster
strikes
when
people
face
hardship
when
the
beauty
and
glory
of
our
outdoor
spaces
must
be
restored
and
taken
care
of
America
turns
to
the
Boy
Scouts
because
we
know
that
the
Boy
Scouts
never
ever
ever
let
us
down
Just
like
you
know
you
can
count
on
me
we
know
we
can
count
on
you
because
we
know
the
values
that
you
live
by
Your
values
are
the
same
values
that
have
always
kept
America
strong
proud
and
free
And
by
the
way
do
you
see
the
billions
and
billions
and
billions
of
additional
money
that
were
putting
back
into
our
military
Billions
of
dollars
New
planes
new
ships
great
equipment
for
our
people
that
are
so
great
to
us
We
love
our
vets
We
love
our
soldiers
And

Two
days
ago
I
traveled
to
Norfolk
Virginia
to
commission
an
American
aircraft
carrier
into
the
fleet
of
the
United
States
Navy
Its
the
newest
largest
and
most
advanced
aircraft
carrier
anywhere
in
the
world
and
its
named
for
an
Eagle
Scout

the
USS
Gerald
R
Ford
Everywhere
it
sails
that
great
Scouts
name
will
be
feared
and
revered
because
that
ship
will
be
a
symbol
of
American
power
prestige
and
strength
Our
nation
honors
President
Gerald
R
Ford
today
because
he
lived
his
life
the
scouting
way

Thank

By

You

pride
in
the

for
every
citizen
of

Generations
of
American
Boy

the

law
You

American
tradition
And
as

embark
on

Karen
Handel
on
her
incredible

in
Georgia

The
election
takes
place
on
June
th
And
by
the
way
on
primaries
lets
not
have

Republicans
running
for
the
same
position
okay
Its
too
nerveshattering
Shes
totally
for
the
NRA
and
shes
totally
for
the
Second
Amendment
So
get
out
and
vote
Shes
running
against
someone
whos
going
to
raise
your
taxes
to
the
sky
destroy
your
healthcare
and
hes
for
open
borderslots
of
crime
and
hes
not
even
able
to
vote
in
the
district
that
hes
running
in
Other

doing
a
fantastic
job
right
So
get
out
and
vote
for
Karen
Also
my
friendhes
become
a
friend
because
theres
nobody
that
does
it
like
Lee
Greenwood
Wow
Lees
anthem
is
the
perfect
description
of
the
renewed
spirit
sweeping
across
our
country
And
it
really
is
indeed
sweeping
across
our
country
So
Lee
I
know
I
speak
for
everyone
in
this
arena
when
I
say
we
are
all
very
proud
indeed
to
be
an
American
Thank
you
very
much
Lee
No
one
was
more
proud
to
be
American
than
the
beloved
patriotand
you
know
who
Im
talking
aboutwe
remember
on
gatherings
like
today
your
former
fiveterm
President
the
late
Charlton
Heston
How
good
was
Charlton
And
I
remember
Charlton
he
was
out
there
fighting
when
maybe
a
lot
of
people
didnt
want
to
be
fighting
He
was
out
there
for
a
long
time
He
was
a
great
guy
And
its
truly
wonderful
to
be
back
in
Atlanta
and
back
with
my
friends
at
the
NRA
You
are
my
friends
believe
me
Perhaps
some
of
you
remember
the
last
time
we
were
all
together
Remember
that
We
had
a
big
crowd
then
too
So
we
knew
something
was
happening
But
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
historic
political
year
and
in
the
middle
of
a
truly
historic
election
What
fun
that
wasNovember

Wasnt
that
a
great
evening
Do
you
remember
that
evening
Remember
that
Remember
they
were
saying
We
have
breaking
news
Donald
Trump
has
won
the
state
of
Michigan
They
go
Michigan
How
did
thatDonald
Trump
has
won
the
state
of
Wisconsin
whoa
But
earlier
in
the
evening
remember
Florida
North
Carolina
South
Carolina
Pennsylvania
all
the
way
upwe
ran
up
the
East
Coast
And
you
know
the
Republicans
have
a
tremendous
disadvantage
in
the
Electoral
College
you
know
that
Tremendous
disadvantage
And
to
run
the
whole
East
Coast
and
then
you
go
with
Iowa
and
Ohio
and
all
of
the
different
states
It
was
a
great
evening
one
that
a
lot
people
will
never
forgeta
lot
of
people
Not
going
to
forget
that
evening
And
remember
they
said
There
is
no
path
to

For
months
I
was
hearing
that
You
know
theyre
trying
to
suppress
the
vote
So
they
keep
saying
it
so
people
say
you
know
I
really
like
Trump
he
loves
the
Second
Amendment
he
loves
the
NRA
I
love
him
but
lets
go
to
the
movie
because
he
cant
win
Because
theyre
trying
to
suppress
the
vote
But
theyd
sayI
mean
hundreds
of
times
I
heard
there
is
notheres
no
route
Theyd
say
it
There
is
no
route
to

And
we
ended
up
with

So
they
were
right
Not


That
was
some
evening
Big
sports
fans
said
that
was
the
singlemost
exciting
event
theyve
ever
seen
That
includes
Super
Bowls
and
World
Series
and
boxing
matches
That
was
an
exciting
evening
for
all
of
us
and
it
meant
a
lot
Only
one
candidate
in
the
General
Election
came
to
speak
to
you
and
that
candidate
is
now
the
President
of
the
United
States
standing
before
you
again
I
have
a
feeling
that
in
the
next
election
youre
going
to
be
swamped
with
candidates
but
youre
not
going
to
be
wasting
your
time
Youll
have
plenty
of
those
Democrats
coming
over
and
youre
going
to
say
no
sir
no
thank
you

no
maam
Perhaps
maam
It
may
be
Pocahontas
remember
that
And
she
is
not
big
for
the
NRA
that
I
can
tell
you
But
you
came
through
for
me
and
I
am
going
to
come
through
for
you
I
was
proud
to
receive
the
NRAs
earliest
endorsement
in
the
history
of
the
organization
And
today
I
am
also
proud
to
be
the
first
sitting
President
to
address
the
NRA
Leadership
Forum
since
our
wonderful
Ronald
Reagan
in

And
I
want
to
thank
each
and
every
one
of
you
not
only
for
your
help
electing
true
friends
of
the
Second
Amendment
but
for
everything
you
do
to
defend
our
flag
and
our
freedom
With
your
activism
you
helped
to
safeguard
the
freedoms
of
our
soldiers
who
have
bled
and
died
for
us
on
the
battlefields
And
I
know
we
have
many
veterans
in
the
audience
today
and
we
want
to
give
them
a
big
big
beautiful
round
of
applause
And
like
I
promised
we
are
doing
a
really
top
job
already
daysbut
already
with
the
Veterans
Administration
people
are
seeing
a
big
difference
We
are
working
really
hard
at
the
VA
and
youre
going
to
see
it
and
youre
already
seeing
it
And
its
my
honor
Ive
been
telling
you
were
going
to
do
it
and
were
doing
it
Thank
you
The
NRA
protects
in
our
capitols
and
legislative
houses
the
freedoms
that
our
servicemembers
have
won
for
us
on
those
incredible
battlefields
And
its
been
a
tough
fight
against
those
who
would
go
so
far
as
to
ban
private
gun
ownership
entirely
But
I
am
here
to
deliver
you
good
news
And
I
can
tell
you
that
Wayne
and
Chris
have
been
fighting
with
me
long
and
hard
to
make
sure
that
we
were
with
you
today
not
somebody
else
with
an
empty
podium
Because
believe
me
the
podium
would
have
been
empty
They
fought
long
and
hard
and
I
think
you
folks
cannot
thank
them
enough
They
were
with
us
all
the
way
right
from
the
beginning
But
we
have
news
that
youve
been
waiting
for
for
a
long
time
The
eightyear
assault
on
your
Second
Amendment
freedoms
has
come
to
a
crashing
end
You
have
a
true
friend
and
champion
in
the
White
House
No
longer
will
federal
agencies
be
coming
after
lawabiding
gun
owners
No
longer
will
the
government
be
trying
to
undermine
your
rights
and
your
freedoms
as
Americans
Instead
we
will
work
with
you
by
your
side
We
will
work
with
the
NRA
to
promote
responsible
gun
ownership
to
protect
our
wonderful
hunters
and
their
access
to
the
very
beautiful
outdoors
You
met
my
sonI
can
tell
you
both
sons
they
love
the
outdoors
Frankly
I
think
they
love
the
outdoors
more
than
they
love
by
a
long
shot
Fifth
Avenue
But
thats
okay
And
we
want
to
ensure
you
of
the
sacred
right
of
selfdefense
for
all
of
our
citizens
When
I
spoke
to
this
forum
last
year
our
nation
was
still
mourning
the
loss
of
a
giant
a
great
defender
of
the
Constitution
Justice
Antonin
Scalia
I
promised
that
if
elected
I
would
nominate
a
justice
who
would
be
faithful
and
loyal
to
the
Constitution
I
even
went
one
step
further
and
publicly
presented
a
list
of

judges
from
which
I
would
make
my
selection
and
thats
exactly
what
we
did
And
by
the
way
I
want
to
thank
really
Heritage
And
I
want
to
thank
also
all
of
the
people
that
worked
with
us
Wheres
Leo
Is
Leo
around
here
Where
is
he
Hes
got
to
be
here
Where
is
he
He
has
been
so
good
And
also
from
Heritage
Jim
DeMint
Its
been
amazing
I
mean
those
people
have
been
fantastic
Theyve
been
real
friends
The
Federalist
peoplewhere
are
they
Are
they
around
here
someplace
They
really
helped
us
out
I
kept
my
promise
and
now
with
your
help
our
brandnew
Justiceand
he
is
really
something
very
specialNeil
Gorsuch
sits
on
the
bench
of
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
For
the
first
time
in
the
modern
political
era
we
have
confirmed
a
new
justice
in
the
first

days
The
last
time
that
happened
was

years
ago
in

Now
we
wont
get
any
credit
for
this
but
dont
worry
about
it
the
credit
is
in
the
audience
right
The
credit
is
in
the
audience
All
of
those
people
They
wont
give
us
credit
but
its
been
a
long
time
and
were
very
honored
Weve
also
taken
action
to
stand
up
for
Americas
sportsmen
On
their
very
last
full
day
in
office
the
previous
administration
issued
an
thhour
rule
to
restrict
the
use
of
lead
ammunition
on
certain
federal
lands
Have
you
heard
about
that
folks
Im
shocked
to
hear
that
Youve
all
heard
about
that
Youve
heard
about
that
On
his
first
day
as
Secretary
of
the
Interior
Ryan
Zinke
eliminated
the
previous
administrations
ammunition
ban
Hes
going
to
be
great
Ryan
is
going
to
be
great
Weve
also
moved
very
quickly
to
restore
something
gun
owners
care
about
very
very
much
Its
called
the
rule
of
law
We
have
made
clear
that
our
administration
will
always
stand
with
the
incredible
men
and
women
of
law
enforcement
In
fact
countless
members
of
law
enforcement
are
also
members
of
the
NRA
because
our
police
know
that
responsible
gun
ownership
saves
lives
and
that
the
right
of
selfdefense
is
essential
to
public
safety
Do
we
all
agree
with
that
Our
police
and
sheriffs
also
know
that
when
you
ban
guns
only
the
criminals
will
be
armed
For
too
long
Washington
has
gone
after
lawabiding
gun
owners
while
making
life
easier
for
criminals
drug
dealers
traffickers
and
gang
members
MSyou
know
about
MS
Its
not
pleasant
for
them
anymore
folks
Its
not
pleasant
for
them
anymore
Thats
a
bad
group
Not
pleasant
for
MS
Get
them
the
hell
out
of
here
right
Get
them
out
We
are
protecting
the
freedoms
of
lawabiding
Americans
and
we
are
going
after
the
criminal
gangs
and
cartels
that
prey
on
our
innocent
citizens
And
we
are
really
going
after
them
As
members
of
the
NRA
know
well
some
of
the
most
important
decisions
a
President
can
make
are
appointmentsand
Ive
appointed
people
who
believe
in
law
order
and
justice
That
is
why
I
have
selected
as
your
Attorney
General
number
one
a
really
fine
person
a
really
good
man
a
man
who
has
spent
his
career
fighting
crime
supporting
the
police
and
defending
the
Second
Amendment
For
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
you
now
have
a
proSecondAmendment
toughoncrime
Attorney
General
and
his
name
is
Jeff
Sessions
And
Attorney
General
Sessions
is
putting
our
priorities
into
action
Hes
going
after
the
drug
dealers
who
are
peddling
their
poison
all
over
our
streets
and
destroying
our
youth
Hes
going
after
the
gang
members
who
threaten
our
children
And
hes
fully
enforcing
our
immigration
laws
in
all

states
And
you
know
what
Its
about
time
Heading
up
the
effort
to
secure
Americas
borders
is
a
great
military
general
a
man
of
action
Homeland
Security
Director
sic
John
Kelly
Secretary
Kelly
who
used
to
be
General
Kelly
is
following
through
on
my
pledge
to
protect
the
borders
remove
criminal
aliens
and
stop
the
drugs
from
pouring
into
our
country
Weve
already
seen

listen
to
this
it
never
happened
before
people
cant
even
believe
it
And
by
the
way
we
will
build
the
wall
no
matter
how
low
this
number
gets
or
how
this
goes
Dont
even
think
about
it
Dont
even
think
about
it
You
know
theyre
trying
to
use
this
number
against
us
because
weve
done
so
unbelievably
at
the
borders
already
Theyre
trying
to
use
it
against
us
But
you
need
that
wall
to
stop
the
human
trafficking
to
stop
the
drugs
to
stop
the
wrong
people
You
need
the
wall
But
listen
to
this
Weve
already
seen
a

percent
decrease

never
happened
before

in
illegal
immigration
on
the
southern
border
since
my
election


percent
You
see
what
theyre
doing
right
So
why
do
you
need
a
wall
We
need
a
wall
